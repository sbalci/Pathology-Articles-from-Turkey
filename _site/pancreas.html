<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:While abundant myeloid cell populations in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) microenvironment have been postulated to suppress anti-tumor immunity, the composition of these populations, their spatial locations, and how they relate to patient outcomes are poorly understood. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:To generate spatially-resolved tumor and immune cell data at single cell resolution, we developed two quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence assays to interrogate myeloid cells (CD15, CD14, ARG1, CD33, HLA-DR) and macrophages [CD68, CD163, CD86, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), MRC1 (CD206)] in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Spatial point pattern analyses were conducted to assess the degree of co-localization between tumor cells and immune cells. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations with patient outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In a multi-institutional cohort of 305 primary PDAC resection specimens, myeloid cells were abundant, enriched within stromal regions, highly heterogeneous across tumors, and differed by somatic genotype. High densities of CD15+ARG1+ immunosuppressive granulocytic cells and M2-polarized macrophages were associated with worse patient survival. Moreover, beyond cell density, closer proximity of M2-polarized macrophages to tumor cells was strongly associated with disease-free survival, revealing the clinical significance and biologic importance of immune cell localization within tumor areas. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:A diverse set of myeloid cells are present within the PDAC tumor microenvironment and are distributed heterogeneously across patient tumors. Not only the densities but also the spatial locations of myeloid immune cells are associated with patient outcomes, highlighting the potential role of spatially-resolved myeloid cell subtypes as quantitative biomarkers for PDAC prognosis and therapy.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Mesothelin (MSLN) is a GPI-linked tumor antigen overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including ovarian, pancreatic, lung and triple-negative breast cancer. Early signs of clinical efficacy with MSLN-targeting agents have validated MSLN as a promising target for therapeutic intervention, but therapies with improved efficacy are still needed to address the significant, unmet medical need posed by MSLN-expressing cancers. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We designed HPN536, a 53-kDa, trispecific, T cell-activating protein-based construct (TriTAC), which binds to MSLN-expressing tumor cells, CD3ε on T cells and to serum albumin. Experiments were conducted to assess the potency, activity and half-life of HPN536 in in vitro assays, rodent models and in non-human primates. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:HPN536 binds to MSLN-expressing tumor cells and to CD3ε on T cells leading to T cell activation and potent redirected target cell lysis. A third domain of HPN536 binds to serum albumin for extension of plasma half-life. In cynomolgus monkeys, HPN536 at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg demonstrated MSLN-dependent pharmacologic activity, was well tolerated and showed pharmacokinetics in support of weekly dosing in humans. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:HPN536 is potent, well tolerated and exhibits extended half-life in non-human primates. It is current in phase 1 clinical testing in patients with MSLN-expressing malignancies (NCT03872206).</p>

<p>Endocrine insufficiency is a common and frequent complication of chronic pancreatitis. Identifying the role of pancreatic damage in the development of diabetes is important for early identification and appropriate management. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:All consecutive CP patients between January 2019 and May 2020 were retrospectively studied. Relevant statistical tests were performed. A two sided p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Total 587 chronic pancreatitis patients were included of which 118 (20.1%) patients developed diabetes with duration of 12 (IQR 4-48) months. Older age (OR 1.079; 95% CI 1.045-1.113; p &lt; 0.001), presence of pancreatic parenchymal (OR 2.284; 95% CI 1.036-5.038; p = 0.041) and ductal (OR 2.351; 95% CI 1.062-5.207; p = 0.035) calcifications, exocrine insufficiency (OR 6.287; 95% CI 2.258-17.504; p &lt; 0.001), and pancreatic duct stricture (OR 3.358; 95% CI 1.138-9.912; p = 0.028) were independently associated with development of diabetes mellitus in chronic pancreatitis patients. On cox-regression analysis, smoking (HR 2.370; 95% CI 1.290-4.354; p = 0.005) and pancreatic ductal calcification (HR 2.033; 95% CI 1.286-3.212; p = 0.002) were independently associated with earlier onset of diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pancreatic calcification, pancreatic duct stricture and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency are associated with development of diabetes mellitus in chronic pancreatitis indicating disease progression. Smoking is the modifiable risk factors associated with early onset of diabetes mellitus in CP patients.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and management of gastric outlet obstruction following acute pancreatitis(AP). Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is not uncommon in acute pancreatitis (AP) and can occur throughout the course. However, the clinical features and related treatment of GOO is rarely reported. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A retrospective review of AP patients with a diagnosis of GOO from March 2017 to June 2020 was performed. The diagnosis and management of GOO, as well as the demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes of the study patients, were collected and analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Over the three years, there were 60 AP patients developed GOO, constituting an incidence of 5.7%. Thirty-three patients (55.0%, 33/60) developed GOO in the first 4 weeks and 27 patients (45.0%, 27/60) after 4 weeks from onset. Pancreatic necrosis compression (60.6%; 20/33), gastric outlet gastrointestinal edema (27.3%, 9/33) are the main causes of early-onset GOO (≤4 weeks), while wall-off necrosis (92.6%, 25/27) is the leading cause in the late phase (&gt;4 weeks). The management of GOO incorporates both supportive and specific treatment like gastric decompression, gastric juice reinfusion, percutaneous catheter drainage, etc. The mortality of AP patients with GOO (≤4 weeks) was 21.2% and none patients who developed GOO (&gt;4 weeks) died. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:GOO, as a gastrointestinal complication developed in AP patients, has two peak incidences in the duration of AP and needs to be paid more attention to.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic duct ligation in a minipig model leads to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This allows the study of digestive processes and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. However, detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure, perioperative management, a determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are scarce in the literature. Data of the long-term health status of minipigs upon EPI induction are still not available. Therefore, the present study describes in detail an experimental approach to the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency via pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs and the long term follow up of the animal’s health state. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:14 Goettingen minipigs underwent pancreatic duct ligation via midline laparotomy for the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal fat content, fat absorption, chymotrypsin levels, body weight and blood vitamin and glucose levels were determined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was successfully induced in 12 Goettingen minipigs. Two minipigs failed to develop exocrine insufficiency most likely due to undetected accessory pancreatic ducts. All animals tolerated the procedure very well and gained weight within 8 weeks after surgery without requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The follow up for approx. 180 weeks showed a stable body weight and health state of the animals with normal blood glucose levels (Table 1). From approx. 130 weeks post pancreatic duct ligation, all animals were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes and vitamins resulting in blood concentrations almost within the reference range. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs is an excellent method of inducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is important to identify and ligate accessory pancreatic ducts since persistence of accessory ducts will lead to maintenance of exocrine pancreatic function. The EPI model caused no persistent side effects in the animals and has the potential to be used in long-term EPI studies with up to 100 weeks post-OP without supplementation with enzymes and vitamins.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Patients with low-risk lesions require ongoing surveillance since the rate of progression to pancreatic cancer (PC), while small, is much greater than in the general population. Our objective was to study the relationship between new onset diabetes (NODM) and progression in patients with low risk mucinous cysts. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We evaluated a prospectively maintained cohort of 442 patients with a suspected mucinous cyst without worrisome features (WF) or high-risk stigmata (HRS). Multivariable Cox models were developed for progression to WF and HRS, with diabetes status formulated as both time independent and dependent covariates. The adjusted cumulative risk of progression was calculated using the corrected group prognosis method. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The 5-year cumulative progression rates to WFs and HRS were 12.8 and 3.6%, respectively. After controlling for other risk factors, the development of NODM was strongly associated with progression to HRS (HR = 11.6; 95%CI, 3.5-57.7%), but not WF. Among patients with the smallest cysts (&lt;10 mm) at baseline, those who developed NODM had a 5-year adjusted cumulative risk of progression to HRS of 8.6% (95%CI, 0.0%-20.2%), compared to only 0.8% (95%CI, 0.0%-2.3%) for patients without NODM. Among patients with the largest cysts (20-29 mm), those who developed NODM during surveillance had a 5-year adjusted cumulative risk of progression of 53.5% (95%CI, 19.6%-89.9%) compared to only 7.5% (95%CI, 1.6%-15.2%) for patients without NODM. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:New onset diabetes may predict progression in patients with low risk mucinous cysts. Pending validation with large-scale studies, these findings support regular diabetes screening among patients surveilled for suspected IPMNs or MCNs.</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a world-wide pandemic since its onset in December of 2019. Although, a primary respiratory pathogen, over the ensuing period, its extra-pulmonary effects have come to the forefront. The virus, having multi-organ tropism, has been shown to affect a host of other organs beyond the lung, including the pancreas. The data on pancreatic involvement by COVID-19, however, have been limited. Moreover, whether the effects on the pancreas are due to the direct effects of the virus or is just an epi-phenomenon is debatable. The prevalence of pancreatic injury and degree of injury are the other issues that need to be addressed. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and the management of the same in the COVID era needs to be tailored assessing the risk-benefit ratio for the same. Additionally, pancreatic surgery increases not only the morbidity of the patient, but also the risk of the operator and burden on the health care system. Hence, the decision for such major procedures needs to be rationalized for optimum benefit during this pandemic. Similarly, for the endoscopist, pancreatic endoscopy needs to be carefully regulated to reduce risk to both the patient and the physician and yet deliver optimum patient care. This review gives a concise summary of various aspects of pancreatic involvement and pancreatic disease management during this pandemic.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, cancer remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein (IGF2BP) family has been reported to be involved in a variety of human malignant tumours. However, little is known about their expression and prognostic value in human pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we performed a detailed cancer versus normal differential analysis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases were used to analyse the mRNA expression levels of the IGF2BP family in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Then, the LinkedOmics and GEPIA databases were used to assess the relation between the expression levels of IGF2BPs and overall survival (OS). Then, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed, and subgroups based on grade and stage were analysed. The signalling pathways associated with IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 were then investigated via gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 were associated with each subset of OS based on grade and stage. Further clinical correlation analysis of IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 confirmed that IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 are fundamental factors in promoting pancreatic cancer progression. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 are key factors in promoting the progression of pancreatic cancer and are closely related to overall survival.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Surgical resection is the major way to cure pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, this operation is complex, and the peri-operative risk is high, making patients more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, establishing a risk model that predicts admission to ICU is meaningful in preventing patients from post-operation deterioration and potentially reducing socio-economic burden. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively collected 120 clinical features from 1242 PDAC patients, including demographic data, pre-operative and intra-operative blood tests, in-hospital duration, and ICU status. Machine learning pipelines, including Supporting Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Lasso Regression, were employed to choose an optimal model in predicting ICU admission. Ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and Lasso Regression were adopted in the correlation analysis of post-operative bleeding, total in-hospital duration, and discharge costs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:SVM model achieved higher performance than the other two models, resulted in an AU-ROC of 0.80. The features, such as age, duration of operation, monocyte count, and intra-operative partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), are risk factors in the ICU admission. The protective factors include RBC count, analgesic pump dexmedetomidine (DEX), and intra-operative maintenance of DEX. Basophil percentage, duration of the operation, and total infusion volume were risk variables for staying in ICU. The bilirubin, CA125, and pre-operative albumin were associated with the post-operative bleeding volume. The operation duration was the most important factor for discharge costs, while pre-lymphocyte percentage and the absolute count are responsible for less cost. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We observed that several new indicators such as DEX, monocyte count, basophil percentage, and intra-operative PaO2 showed a good predictive effect on the possibility of admission to ICU and duration of stay in ICU. This work provided an essential reference for indication in advance to PDAC operation.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is aggressive, with an overall five-year survival rate of 9%, and few patients are candidates for pancreatectomy at presentation. The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Due to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT, and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. 118 resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were selected from the cases between 2011-2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes. There were statistically significant differences for dystrophic calcification, eosinophilic tumor cell changes, elastotic stromal/vascular change, islet cell hyperplasia, and nerve hypertrophy between the two groups, with these features seen more frequently in NAT cases. Blue/grey stromal fibrosis was present in all cases regardless of NAT, except few complete regression cases and one treated case with intraneural invasion only. Blue/grey fibrosis is a useful histologic visual clue to suggest the possibility of adjacent tumor in the majority of PDAC cases regardless of NAT. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, neither grading scheme correlated with overall survival in our cohort. However, the MD Anderson score was significantly correlated with both time to primary tumor recurrence (p=0.002) and time to distant recurrence (p=0.04); while the modified Ryan score did not.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Intractable serous (not chylous) ascites (IA) that infrequently develops early following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic cancer is a life-threatening problem. The relationship between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) for pancreatic cancer and the incidence of IA following PD has not been evaluated. This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with IA that develops early after PD for pancreatic cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively identified 94 patients who underwent PD for pancreatic cancer at the Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka Medical College Hospital, Osaka, Japan, from April 2012 to March 2020. Data on 29 parameters were obtained from medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors. Levels of serum albumin were compared before and after NACRT to analyze its effect. Survival analysis was also conducted. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 92 patients included in this study, 8 (8.70%) were categorized into the IA group. Multivariate analysis identified NACRT [odds ratio (OR) 27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-394, p = 0.016)] and hypoalbuminemia (≤ 1.6 g/dl) just after the operation (OR 50, 95% CI 1.68-1516, p = 0.024) as risk factors. The level of serum albumin was significantly decreased following NACRT. The IA group had poorer prognosis than the control group. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:IA is a serious problem that aggravates patient’s prognosis. Postoperative lymphatic leak might be a trigger of IA. NACRT was a major risk factor, followed by hypoalbuminemia caused by various reasons. These factors may act synergistically and cause IA.</p>

<p>HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is a transcript produced from the antisense strand of the HOXC gene cluster and influencing expression of genes from the HOXD locus. HOTAIR has prominent roles in different aspects of carcinogenic process from cancer initiation to metastasis. A number of in vitro, in vivo and human investigations have confirmed the oncogenic impacts of HOTAIR. The diagnostic power of HOTAIR in distinguishing cancer status from healthy status has been optimal in gastric cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. The most important achievement in this regard has been provided by studies that verified diagnostic value of this lncRNA in the serum samples, potentiating its application in non-invasive diagnosis of cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR has a crucial role in determination of response of cancer cells to therapeutic modalities. The current review aims to explain the outlines of these studies to emphasize its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for these conditions.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to examine whether elevated in-hospital mortality rates in lower volume hospitals are only valid on average or also apply for individual hospitals. Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Various studies demonstrated a volume-outcome relationship in pancreatic surgery with increased mortality in low volume hospitals. However, almost all studies assessed quality indicators only for groups of hospitals by averaged measures, neglecting variability of hospital performance. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The German nationwide hospital discharge data (diagnosis-related groups-statistics) was used to determine risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality for all distal pancreatectomies (DP), pancreatoduodenectomies (Whipple-procedure, PD), and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomies (PPD) performed between 2011 and 2015. Hospitals were stratified according to annual and 5-year total procedure volume and examined in relation to average in-hospital mortality of the highest volume quintile. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Lowest adjusted mortality rates were observed in highest volume quintiles for each pancreatic resection procedure, with 6.2% for DP, 8.3% for PD, and 5.7% for PPD in the 5-year observation period. With these mortality rates as reference values the analysis revealed that a non-negligible proportion of hospitals performed equal or better (DP: 430/784, 54.5%; PD: 269/611, 44.0%; PPD: 255/565, 45.1%) than the hospitals of the highest volume quintile. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:High quality of care, with in-hospital mortality rates less or equal to high-volume hospitals, is also achieved in hospitals with lesser procedure volume. Therefore, mere volume seems not suitable as proximal measure for assessing individual hospital quality. Instead, more sophisticated certification systems, that allow accurate quality assessment and better reflect clinical variability, should preferred to fixed minimum volume thresholds.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly used for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is unknown whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy (NCRT vs. NAC). We aim to compare pathological and survival outcomes of NCRT and NAC in patients with PDAC. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Single-center analysis of PDAC patients treated with NCRT or NAC followed by resection between December 2008 and December 2018 was performed. Average treatment effect (ATE) was estimated after case-control matching using Mahalanobis distance nearest-neighbor matching. Inverse probability weighted estimates (IPWE)-based ATE was estimated for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among the 418 patients (mean age 66.8 years, 51% female) included in the study, 327 received NAC and 91 received NCRT. NCRT patients had higher rates of locally advanced disease, number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles, more chemotherapy regimen crossover (gemcitabine and 5-FU based), and were more likely to undergo open surgical procedures and/or vascular resection (all p &lt; 0.05). After matched analysis, NCRT was associated with a significant reduction in lymph node positive disease [ATE = (-)0.24, p = 0.007] and lymphovascular invasion [ATE = (-)0.20, p = 0.02]. While NCRT was associated with significantly improved DFS by 9.5 months (p = 0.006), it did not affect OS by IPWE-based ATE after adjusting for adjuvant therapy (ATE = 5.5 months; p = 0.32). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Compared with NAC alone, NCRT is associated with improved pathologic surrogates and disease-free survival, but not overall survival in patients with PDAC.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This phase Ia/Ib PACT study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of a new PD-L1 inhibitor, LY3300054, as monotherapy or in combination with ramucirumab, abemaciclib, or merestinib (a type II MET kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors (NCT02791334). Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients were enrolled into cohorts of escalating LY3300054 dose (phase Ia) as monotherapy (N=15) or combined with ramucirumab (N=10), abemaciclib (N=24), or merestinib (N=12). The phase Ib dose expansion enrolled eight patients with melanoma in the monotherapy arm and 12 patients with pancreatic cancer in the merestinib combination arm. Combination treatments were administered concurrently from day 1 of each cycle. A 14-day lead-in abemaciclib arm was also explored. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and safety. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Treatment-related adverse events included fatigue and nausea in the monotherapy arm (13% for each), hypothyroidism (30%) in the ramucirumab arm, diarrhea (54%) in the abemaciclib arm, and nausea (25%) in the merestinib arm. DLTs associated with hepatoxicity were observed in three of four patients in the abemaciclib lead-in cohorts. No DLTs or grade 3 or 4 hepatoxicity were reported in the concurrent abemaciclib arm. Pharmacokinetic characteristics were comparable to other PD-L1 inhibitors. One patient in each arm experienced a partial response per RECIST v1.1 lasting ≥7 months. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:LY3300054 was well tolerated without unexpected safety concerns when administered alone or concurrently with ramucirumab, abemaciclib, or merestinib. Lead-in abemaciclib before combining with LY3300054 was not feasible due to hepatotoxicity. Durable clinical benefits were seen in all regimens.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are malignancies with a leading lethality. With reference to interferons (IFNs) known to mediate antitumor activities, this study investigated the relationship between germline genetic variations in type III IFN genes and cancer disease progression from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. The genetic variations under study tag a gain-or-loss-of-function dinucleotide polymorphism within the IFNL4 gene, rs368234815 [TT/ΔG]. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The entirety of the TCGA sequencing data was used to assess genotypes of 187 patients with HCC and of 162 patients with PDAC matched for ethnicity. Stratified for IFNL genotypes, both cohorts were subjected to time-to-event analyses according to Kaplan-Meier with regard to the length of the specific progression free interval (PFI) and the overall survival (OS) time as two clinical endpoints for disease progression. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Logrank analysis revealed a significant relationship between IFNL genotypes and disease outcome for PDAC. This relationship was not found for HCC. A multiple Cox regression analysis employing patients’ age, tumor grade and tumor stage as further covariates proved IFNL genotypes to be independent predictors for PDAC disease outcome. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This repository-based approach unveiled clinical evidence suggestive for an impact of IFNL germline variations for PDAC progression with an IFNL haplotype predisposing for IFNL4 expression being favorable.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a complex and heterogeneous genetic disease that has well-established clinical diagnostic criteria. These criteria do not include gastrointestinal tumors. Label=“CASE PRESENTATION” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We report a 45-year-old patient with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of TSC and a family history of cancer, presenting two rare associated findings: gastrointestinal polyposis and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This patient was subjected to a genetic test with 80 cancer predisposing genes. The genetic panel revealed the presence of a large pathogenic deletion in the TSC2 gene, covering exons 2 to 16 and including the initiation codon. No changes were identified in the colorectal cancer and colorectal polyposis genes. Label=“DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We describe a case of TSC that presented tumors of the gastro intestinal tract that are commonly unrelated to the disease. The patient described here emphasizes the importance of considering polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract and low grade neuroendocrine tumor as part of the TSC syndromic phenotype.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Tumor size measurement is critical for accurate tumor staging in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, accurate tumor size measurement is challenging in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before resection, due to treatment-induced fibrosis and tumor invasion beyond the grossly identified tumor area. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the tumor size and tumor volume measured on post-therapy computed tomography (CT) scans and the pathological measurement. Also, we investigated the correlation between these measurements and clinicopathological parameters and survival. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Retrospectively, we evaluated 343 patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant therapy, followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy and had pre-operative pancreatic protocol CT imaging. We measured the longest tumor diameter (RadL) and the radiological tumor volume (RadV) on the post-therapy CT scan, then we categorized RadL into four radiologic tumor stages (RTS) based on the current AJCC staging (8th edition) protocol and RadV based on the median. Pearson correlation or Spearman’s coefficient (δ), T-test and ANOVA was used to test the correlation between the radiological and pathological measurement. Chi-square analysis was used to test the correlation with the tumor pathological response, lymph-node metastasis and margin status and Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard for survival analysis. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:As a continuous variable, RadL showed a positive linear correlation with the post-therapy pathologic tumor size in the overall patient population (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.72, P &lt; 0.001) and RadV (δ: 0.63, p &lt; 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between RadL and pathologic tumor size in patients with ypT0 and those with pathologic tumor size of ≤1.0 cm. Post-therapy RTS and RadV group correlated with ypT stage, tumor response grades using either CAP or MDA grading system, distance of superior mesenteric artery margin and tumor recurrence/metastasis. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Although RadL tends to understage ypT in PDAC patients who had no radiologically detectable tumor or small tumors (RTS0 or RTS1), radiologic measurement of post-therapy tumor size may be used as a marker for the pathologic tumor staging and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is important for the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions. Sample adequacy is related to the number of needle passes, and European guidelines recommend three to four needle passes with a standard EUS-FNA needle. We aimed to evaluate the optimal number of passes with standard EUS-FNA needles in solid pancreatic lesions. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients with solid pancreatic masses without cystic component &gt;20% on computed tomography scan, and without biliary metallic stents, or coagulation problems were included prospectively. Standard 22G needles were used (maximum four passes); each sample was paraffin-embedded and analyzed separately. Final diagnosis was established by EUS-FNA, repeat EUS-FNA, surgery, or follow-up. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Sixty-one of 65 patients were included. The final diagnoses were adenocarcinoma (n = 44, 72%), neuroendocrine tumor (NET) (n = 10, 16%), metastasis (n = 1, 4%) and nonmalignant lesion (n = 6, 10%). Immunohistochemical staining was possible in 17 cases. The diagnosis was established by the first pass in 62% of cases (n = 38), by the second in 15% (n = 9), by the third in 15% (n = 9), and by the fourth in 3% (n = 2). The diagnostic accuracy for all four passes compared to the first three passes was 95% vs 92% (P = .5). The contribution of the fourth pass was not different between adenocarcinoma and NET (2% vs 10%, respectively; P = .667). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Three passes with standard EUS-FNA was optimal for a specific diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses, regardless of the histological type of the lesion.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:An epidermoid cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen (ECIPAS) in the pancreas head is an extremely rare condition. The natural course of this condition is not well known, and it is difficult to diagnose before surgery due to the lack of specific imaging findings. Label=“CASE PRESENTATION” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A tumor was found in the head of the pancreas in a 68-year-old man with abdominal distension and discomfort. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested a malignant tumor, such as a colloid cancer. The tumor was removed surgically, with pathologic examination showing that it was an ECIPAS. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:ECIPAS cannot be easily distinguished from other pancreatic cystic tumors, making it necessary to include ECIPAS in the differential diagnosis of these tumors. Unnecessary surgical resection may be avoided by more accurate preoperative diagnosis based on clinical and imaging characteristics.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The transcription factor capicua (CIC) regulates mammalian development and homeostasis. Growing evidence shows that CIC suppresses various human cancers by directly repressing the downstream cancer-related target genes. This study investigated the clinical and biologic significance of CIC expression in pancreatic cancer (PC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The study reviewed 132 patients with PC who underwent curative resection. The patients were divided into two groups according to CIC immunoreactivity score by immunohistochemistry, and the associations between CIC expression, clinicopathologic characteristics, and postoperative prognosis were investigated. Moreover, the influence of CIC expression on the malignant potential of PC cells was assessed with cell proliferation, motility assays, and use of quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot on the downstream target genes of CIC in knockdown experiments. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The low-CIC expression group showed a higher proportion of lymphatic invasion (72.9% vs. 53.1%; p = 0.024), intrapancreatic neural invasion (94.1% vs. 81.3%; p = 0.021), and extrapancreatic plexus invasion (30.9% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.0006) than the high-CIC expression group as well as significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.0002) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.0041) rates. Low CIC expression was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (p = 0.038). Pancreatic cancer cells with knockdown CIC significantly enhanced cell motilities and cell cycle progression, promoted expression levels of ETV4 and MMP-9, and induced EMT. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The study elucidated the association of low CIC expression with a poor prognosis for patients with PC and suggested that the CIC-ETV4-MMP-9 axis might control PC progression.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study evaluates the variation in spending by the highest-quality hospitals performing complex cancer surgery in the United States. Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:As mortality rates for high-risk cancer surgery have improved, increased attention has focused on other elements of quality, such as complications. However, high-value surgical care requires both high-quality care and cost savings. Therefore, understanding any residual cost variation among high-quality hospitals is essential in order to better direct efforts to achieve efficient, high-value care. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medicare beneficiaries age 65 to 99 who underwent surgery for pancreas, esophageal, lung, rectal, and colon cancer from 2014 to 2016 were identified. The highest-quality hospitals were identified as those in the quintile with the lowest risk- and reliability-adjusted serious complication rates for each operation. Within this cohort of high-quality hospitals, thirty-day total episode, index hospitalization, physician, postacute care, and readmission spending was analyzed. Logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the probability of postoperative outcomes and post-discharge resource utilization. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:43,007 Medicare patients underwent either pancreas, esophageal, lung, rectal, or colon resection for cancer at a hospital within the highest-quality quintile. Among the highest quality hospitals, total episode spending ranged from $18,712 for colectomy to $38,054 for esophagectomy. Spending between the lowest- and highest spending hospitals varied from $1,207 (CI95% $1,195 to $1,220) or 6.6% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for colectomy to $5,706 (CI95% $5,506 to $5,906) or 16.1% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for esophagectomy. The largest component of variation was from postacute care spending followed by readmission. For all operations the risk-adjusted rate of postacute care facility utilization was lower among the lowest spending hospitals compared to the highest spending hospitals. For example, for pancreas the lowest-spending hospitals on average discharged patients to a postacute care facility at a rate of 18,6% (CI95% 16.2 to 20.9) compared to 31.0% (CI95% 28.2 to 33.9) in the highest-spending hospitals. In all operations, the risk-adjusted readmission rate was lower among the lowest-spending hospitals compared to the highest-spending hospitals. For instance, within the esophagus cohort, the lowest-spending hospitals had an average risk-adjusted readmission rate of 17.3% compared to 29.4% in the highest spending hospitals (p &lt; 0.001). Label=“CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Even among the highest-quality hospitals, significant cost variation persists among cancer operations. Post-acute care variation, rather than residual variation in complication rates, explains the majority of this variation and represents an immediately actionable target for increased cost efficiency.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study aimed to identify risk factors for recurrence after pancreatic resection for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Long-term follow-up data on recurrence after surgical resection for IPMN are currently lacking. Previous studies have presented mixed results on the role of margin status in risk of recurrence after surgical resection. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 126 patients that underwent resection for noninvasive IPMN were followed for a median of 9.5 years. Dedicated pathological and radiological reviews were performed to correlate clinical and pathological features (including detailed pathological features of the parenchymal margin) with recurrence after surgical resection. In addition, in a subset of 32 patients with positive margins, we determined the relationship between the margin and original IPMN using driver gene mutations identified by next-generation sequencing. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Family history of pancreatic cancer and high-grade IPMN was identified as risk factors for recurrence in both uni- and multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 3.05 and 1.88, respectively). Although positive margin was not significantly associated with recurrence in our cohort, the size and grade of the dysplastic focus at the margin were significantly correlated with recurrence in margin-positive patients. Genetic analyses showed that the neoplastic epithelium at the margin was independent from the original IPMN in at least 9 of 32 cases (28%). The majority of recurrences (74%) occurred after 3 years, and a significant minority (32%) occurred after 5 years. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Sustained postoperative surveillance for all patients is indicated, particularly those with risk factors such has family history and high-grade dysplasia.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:A soft remnant texture of the pancreas is commonly accepted as a risk factor for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). However, its assessment is subjective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of intraoperative amylase level of the pancreatic juice as a risk factor of POPF after PD. Label=“METHOD” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This study included 75 patients who underwent PD between November 2014 and April 2020 at Jikei University Hospital. We investigated the relationship between pancreatic texture, intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice, results of the pathological evaluations, and the incidence of POPF. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Twenty-three patients (31%) developed POPF. The significant predictors of POPF were non-ductal adenocarcinoma (p &lt; 0.01), soft pancreatic remnant (p &lt; 0.01), high intraoperative blood loss (p &lt; 0.01), high intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice (p &lt; 0.01), and low pancreatic fibrosis (p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant independent predictors of POPF were high intraoperative blood loss (p &lt; 0.01) and high intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice (p = 0.02). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the cut-off value for the intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice was 2.17 × 105 IU/L (area under the curve = 0.726, sensitivity = 95.7%, and specificity = 50.0%) CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice is a reliable objective predictor for POPF after PD.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Chemotherapy dose modification to manage adverse events is commonplace in clinical practice. This exploratory analysis evaluates the impact of liposomal irinotecan dose modification on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in the NAPOLI-1 clinical trial (NCT01494506). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Analysis includes only patients enrolled under protocol version 2 who received at least the first 2 scheduled doses of study drug. Within the liposomal irinotecan +5 fluorouracil/leucovorin (5 FU/LV) arm, patients were grouped according to whether or not they had a dose modification within the first 6 weeks. Dose reduction was defined as any decrease from initial dose; dose delay was any dosing delay &gt;3 days from target date. OS and PFS (Kaplan-Meier estimates) were compared within the liposomal irinotecan+5-FU/LV arm and between treatment arms. Unstratified hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 93 patients from the liposomal irinotecan+5 FU/LV arm included in the analysis, 53 experienced a dose modification (both delay and reduction, n = 30; delay only, n = 19; reduction only, n = 4). No apparent difference in median OS or PFS was observed between patients who did versus patients who did not have a dose modification (OS: 8.4 vs 6.7 months; HR, 0.89; PFS: 4.2 vs 3.1 months; HR, 0.74). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:An early dose reduction or delay of liposomal irinotecan+5-FU/LV in the first 6 weeks does not significantly impact OS or PFS compared to patients without dose modifications. This finding suggests that tolerability-guided dose modification of liposomal irinotecan does not adversely affect efficacy outcomes.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND AND AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Molecular evidence of cellular heterogeneity in the human exocrine pancreas has not been yet established, due to the local concentration and cascade of hydrolytic enzymes that can rapidly degrade cells and RNA upon pancreatic resection. We sought to better understand the heterogeneity and cellular composition of the pancreas in neonates and adults in healthy and diseased conditions using single cell sequencing approaches. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We innovated single-nucleus RNA sequencing protocols and profiled more than 120,000 cells from pancreata of adult and neonatal human donors. We validated the single nucleus findings using RNA-FISH, in situ sequencing and computational approaches. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We created the first comprehensive atlas of human pancreas cells, including epithelial and non-epithelial constituents and uncovered three distinct acinar cell types, with possible implications for homeostatic and inflammatory processes of the pancreas. The comparison with neonatal sNuc-seq data revealed a different cellular composition of the endocrine tissue, highlighting tissue dynamics occurring during development. By applying spatial cartography, involving cell proximity mapping through in situ sequencing, we found evidence of specific cell type neighborhoods, dynamic topographies in the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, and principles of morphological organization of the organ. Furthermore, similar analyses in chronic pancreatitis biopsies revealed the presence of acinar-REG+ cells, a reciprocal association between macrophages and activated stellate cells, and a new potential role of Tuft cells in this disease. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our human pancreas cell atlas can be interrogated to understand pancreatic cell biology and provides a crucial reference set for comparisons with diseased tissue samples to map the cellular foundations of pancreatic diseases.Interactive exploration tool and data download: <a href="http://singlecell.charite.de/pancreas" class="uri">http://singlecell.charite.de/pancreas</a>.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:LOY is associated with ageing and increase the incidence of cancers. Label=“AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To elucidate the role of LOY in various cancer types, namely, prostate (PRT), pancreatic (PC) and colorectal (CRC) cancers in males. Label=“MATERIAL AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Fifty CRC patients [mean age = 44.58±11.2 years], fifty PRT [mean age= 60.48± 17.07 years] and fifty PC [mean age = 48.74 ±16.45 years] along with 100 healthy controls [mean age= 54.06 ±15.04 years] were recruited. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and was subjected to multiplex QF-PCR. The Y/X ratio was calculated from the peak height. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The mean Y/X ratio was lower in all patients with cancers (0.875333± 0.086; p value˂ 0.0001) than in controls (1.11 ± 0.071), as well as, in CRC (0.926±0.192; p value˂0.0001), PC (0.85 ± 0.0311; p value˂0.0001) and PRT (0.85±0.122; p value˂0.0001) when calculated separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the strength of the presence of cancer prediction using the percentage of LOY and age showed that LOY (p= 0.001) is a better predictor of cancer presence than age (p= 0.359).

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND”:Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive loss of pancreatic beta cells. Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody specific for tumor necrosis factor α that has already been approved for the treatment of several autoimmune conditions in adults and children. Whether golimumab could preserve beta-cell function in youth with newly diagnosed overt (stage 3) type 1 diabetes is unknown. Label=“METHODS”:In this phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, children and young adults (age range, 6 to 21 years) with newly diagnosed overt type 1 diabetes to receive subcutaneous golimumab or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was endogenous insulin production, as assessed according to the area under the concentration-time curve for C-peptide level in response to a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (4-hour C-peptide AUC) at week 52. Secondary and additional end points included insulin use, the glycated hemoglobin level, the number of hypoglycemic events, the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide over time, and response profile. Label=“RESULTS”:A total of 84 participants underwent randomization - 56 were assigned to the golimumab group and 28 to the placebo group. The mean (±SD) 4-hour C-peptide AUC at week 52 differed significantly between the golimumab group and the placebo group (0.64±0.42 pmol per milliliter vs. 0.43±0.39 pmol per milliliter, P&lt;0.001). A treat-to-target approach led to good glycemic control in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the groups in glycated hemoglobin level. Insulin use was lower with golimumab than with placebo. A partial-remission response (defined as an insulin dose-adjusted glycated hemoglobin level score [calculated as the glycated hemoglobin level plus 4 times the insulin dose] of ≤9) was observed in 43% of participants in the golimumab group and in 7% of those in the placebo group (difference, 36 percentage points; 95% CI, 22 to 55). The mean number of hypoglycemic events did not differ between the trial groups. Hypoglycemic events that were recorded as adverse events at the discretion of investigators were reported in 13 participants (23%) in the golimumab group and in 2 (7%) of those in the placebo group. Antibodies to golimumab were detected in 30 participants who received the drug; 29 had antibody titers lower than 1:1000, of whom 12 had positive results for neutralizing antibodies. Label=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among children and young adults with newly diagnosed overt type 1 diabetes, golimumab resulted in better endogenous insulin production and less exogenous insulin use than placebo.

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To determine the associations of pancreatobiliary maljunction (PBM) in the West. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:PBM (anomalous union of common bile duct and pancreatic duct) is mostly regarded as an Asian-only disorder, with 200X risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC), attributed to reflux of pancreatic enzymes. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Radiologic images of 840 patients in the U.S. who underwent pancreatobiliary resections were reviewed for PBM and contrasted with 171 GBC cases from Japan. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Eight % of the US GBCs (24/300) had PBM (similar to Japan; 15/171, 8.8%), in addition to 1/42 bile duct carcinomas and 5/33 choledochal cysts. None of the 30 PBM cases from the US had been diagnosed as PBM in the original work-up. PBM was not found in other pancreatobiliary disorders. Clinicopathologic features of the 39 PBM-associated GBCs (US:24, Japan:15) were similar; however, comparison with non-PBM GBCs revealed that they occurred predominantly in females (F/M = 3); at younger (&lt;50-year-old) age (21% vs. 6.5% in non-PBM GBCs; p = 0.01); were uncommonly associated with gallstones (14% vs. 58%; p &lt; 0.001); had higher rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (69% vs. 44%; p = 0.04); arose more often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.02); and had a higher proportion of non-conventional carcinomas (21% vs. 7%; p = 0.03). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PBM accounts for 8% of GBCs also in the West but is typically undiagnosed. PBM-GBCs tend to manifest in younger age and often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to unusual carcinoma types. If PBM is encountered, cholecystectomy and surveillance of bile ducts is warranted. PBM-associated GBCs offer an invaluable model for variant anatomy-induced chemical (reflux-related) carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To define frequencies, pattern of progression (invasive versus non-invasive), and risk factors of progression of resected non-invasive IPMNs BACKGROUND:: There is a risk of progression in the remnant pancreas after resection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:449 consecutive patients with resected IPMNs from 1995-2018 were included to the study. Patients with invasive carcinoma or with follow-up &lt; 6 months were excluded. Non-invasive progression was defined as a new IPMN, increased main pancreatic duct (MPD) size, and increased size of an existing lesion (5 mm compared to preoperative imaging). Invasive progression was defined as development of invasive cancer in the remnant pancreas or metastatic disease. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:With a median follow-up of 48.9 months, progression was identified in 124 patients (27.6%); 108(24.1%) with non-invasive and 16(3.6%) with invasive progression. Median progression follow-up was longer for invasive progression (85.4 vs. 55.9 months; P = 0.001). Five- and 10-year estimates for a cumulative incidence of invasive progression were 6.4% and 12.9% versus 26.9% and 41.5% for non-invasive progression. After risk-adjustment, multifocality (HR 4.53, 95%CI 1.34-15.26; P = 0.02) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in the original resection (HR 3.60, 95%CI 1.13-11.48; P = 0.03) were associated with invasive progression. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Progression to invasive carcinoma can occur years after the surgical resection of a non-invasive IPMN. HGD in the original resection is a risk factor for invasive progression but some cases of low-grade dysplasia also progressed to cancer. Patients with high-risk features such as HGD and multifocal cysts should be considered for more intensive surveillance and represent an important cohort for future trials such as anti-inflammatory or prophylactic immunotherapy.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To investigate the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy on surgical complications in patients after pancreatic resection for (borderline-)resectable pancreatic cancer. Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Preoperative chemoradiotherapy is increasingly used in patients with (borderline-)resectable pancreatic cancer. Concerns have been raised about the potential harmful effect of any preoperative therapy on the surgical complication rate after pancreatic resection. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:An observational analysis was performed within the multicenter randomized controlled PREOPANC trial (April 2013-July 2017). The trial randomly assigned (1:1) patients to preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery and the remaining adjuvant chemotherapy or to immediate surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The main analysis consisted of a per-protocol approach. The endpoints of the present analyses were the rate of postoperative complications. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:This study included 246 patients from 16 centers, of whom 66 patients underwent resection after preoperative therapy and 98 patients after immediate surgery. No differences were found regarding major complications (37.9% vs 30.6%, P = 0.400), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (9.1% vs 5.1%, P = 0.352), delayed gastric emptying (21.2% vs 22.4%, P = 0.930), bile leakage (4.5% vs 3.1%, P = 0.686), intra-abdominal infections (12.1% vs 10.2%, P = 0.800), and mortality (3.0% vs 4.1%, P = 1.000). There was a significant lower incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (0% vs 9.2%, P = 0.011). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Preoperative chemoradiotherapy did not increase the incidence of surgical complications or mortality and reduced the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula after resection in patients with (borderline-)resectable pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To evaluate the significance of UDD in IPMNs. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The uncinate process of the pancreas has an independent ductal drainage system. International consensus guidelines of IPMNs still consider it as a branch-duct, even though it is the main drainage system for the uncinate process. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A retrospective review of all surgically treated IPMNs at our institution after 2008 was performed. Preoperative radiological studies were reviewed by an abdominal radiologist who was blinded to the pathological results. In addition to the Fukuoka criteria, presence of UDD was recorded. Using multivariate analysis, the pathological significance of UDD in predicting advanced neoplasia [high grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma (HGD/IC)] was determined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Two hundred sixty patients were identified (mean age at diagnosis was 68 years and 49% were females): 122 (47%) had HGD/IC. UDD was noted in 59 (23%), of which 36 (61%) had HGD/IC (P &lt; 0.003). On multivariate analysis, UDD was an independent predictor of HGD/IC (odds ratio = 2.99, P &lt; 0.04). Subgroup analysis on patients with IPMNs confined to the dorsal portion of the gland (n = 161), also demonstrated UDD to be a significant predictor of HGD/IC in those remote lesions (odds ratio: 4.41, P = 0.039). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This is the largest study to evaluate the significance of UDD in IPMNs and shows it to be a high-risk feature. This association persisted for remote IPMNs limited to the dorsal pancreas, suggesting UDD may be associated with an aggressive phenotype even in remote IPMN lesions.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, which limits surgical options and portends a dismal prognosis. Current oncologic PDAC therapies confer marginal benefit and, thus, a significant unmet clinical need exists for new therapeutic strategies. To identify effective PDAC therapies, we leveraged a syngeneic orthotopic PDAC transplant mouse model to perform a large-scale, in vivo screen of 16 single-agent and 41 two-drug targeted therapy combinations in mice. Among 57 drug conditions screened, combined inhibition of heat shock protein (Hsp)-90 and MEK was found to produce robust suppression of tumor growth, leading to an 80% increase in the survival of PDAC-bearing mice with no significant toxicity. Mechanistically, we observed that single-agent MEK inhibition led to compensatory activation of resistance pathways, including components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, which was overcome with the addition of HSP90 inhibition. The combination of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) was also active in vitro in established human PDAC cell lines and in vivo in patient-derived organoid PDAC transplant models. These findings encourage the clinical development of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) combination therapy and highlight the power of clinically relevant in vivo model systems for identifying cancer therapies.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatoblastoma is a rare pediatric malignant neoplasm characterized by its histological resemblance to fetal pancreatic tissue and poor clinical outcomes. Preoperative diagnosis of the neoplasm is difficult due to its rarity, variable clinical presentation, and its lack of distinct laboratory markers. Current mainstay of treatment is surgical resection of the tumor, although a standard of care has not yet been established. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Data were collected on one patient admitted to the University of Virginia Hospital System. Radiology, hematopoietic cell transplant, and biopsy data were collected according to the best clinical practice. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Herein, we describe the case of an adult patient with pancreatoblastoma treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic cell transplantation. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first documented successful treatment of pancreatoblastoma using autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in the United States, and the first successful treatment in an adult patient worldwide. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:While it is difficult to draw conclusions based on a single case, we would like to highlight the success of this treatment modality in the management of our patient with a 51-month remission and open further discussion into exploring the use of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for pancreatoblastoma. Our patient is currently living 57 months after diagnosis despite the average survival rate being less than 18 months.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma are aggressive tumours where preoperative assessment is challenging. Disseminated tumour cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM) are associated with impaired prognosis in a variety of epithelial cancers. In a cohort of patients with presumed resectable pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma, we evaluated the frequency and the potential prognostic impact of the preoperative presence of DTC, defined as cytokeratin-positive cells detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Preoperative BM samples from 242 patients selected for surgical resection of presumed resectable pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma from 09/2009 to 12/2014, were analysed for presence of CK-positive cells by ICC. The median observation time was 21.5 months. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Successful resections of malignant tumours were performed in 179 of the cases, 30 patients resected had benign pancreatic disease based on postoperative histology, and 33 were deemed inoperable intraoperatively due to advanced disease. Overall survival for patients with resected carcinoma was 21.1 months (95% CI: 18.0-24.1), for those with benign disease OS was 101 months (95% CI: 69.4-132) and for those with advanced disease OS was 8.8 months (95% CI: 4.3-13.3). The proportion of patients with detected CK-positive cells was 6/168 (3.6%) in resected malignant cases, 2/31 (6.5%) in advanced disease and 4/29 (13.8%) in benign disease. The presence of CK-positive cells was not correlated to OS or DFS, neither in the entire cohort nor in the subgroup negative for circulating tumour cells (CTC). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The results indicate that CK-positive cells may be present in both patients with malignant and benign diseases of the pancreas. Detection of CK-positive cells was not associated with differences in prognosis for the entire cohort or any of the subgroups analysed.

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To explore the diagnostic value of pancreatic perfusion CT combined with contrast-enhanced CT in one-time scanning (PCECT) in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) and to evaluate the difference of perfusion parameters between different grades of PNETs. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:From October 2016 to December 2018, forty consecutive patients with histopathological-proven PNETs were identified retrospectively that received PCECT for the preoperative PNETs evaluation. Two board certified radiologists who were blinded to the clinical data evaluated the images independently. The image characters of PNETs vs. tumor-free pancreatic parenchymal and different grades of PNETs were analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:One-time PCECT scanning had a detection rate of 89.1% for PNETs, which was higher than the detection accuracy of the perfusion CT only (83.6%). The perfusion parameters of PNETs including blood volume (BV), blood flow (BF), mean slope of increase (MSI), and capillary surface permeability (PS) were significantly increased than those of tumor-free pancreatic parenchyma (p &lt; 0.05, respectively). For differential comparison between grade I (G1) and grade II (G2) tumors, the parameters of BF and impulse residue function (IRF) of tumor tissue were significantly higher in the G2 tumors (p &lt; 0.05, for both). In this study, the total radiation dose of the whole PCECT scan was 16.241 ± 2.289 mSv. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The one-time PCECT scan may improve the detection of PNETs according to morphological features and perfusion parameters with a relative small radiation dose. The perfusion parameters of BF and IRF may be used to help distinguish G1 and G2 tumors in the preoperative evaluation.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Paratesticular tumors (PTT) are rare and form a heterogenous group, ranging from benign to malignant high grade sarcomas. This study was undertaken to describe the clinicopathological spectrum of PTTs received over a 20-year period. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:All primary and secondary PTTs diagnosed from 2000 to 2019 in the pathology department of a tertiary care hospital in North India were retrospectively reviewed. Gross, histopathological features and immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings were correlated with clinical details. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 169 intra-scrotal tumors were diagnosed during the study period, out of which there were 30 PTTs (in 27 patients) comprising 17.75%. Age range was 4 to 85 years (median 58 years). Benign PTTs were the commonest (n = 21, 70%), followed by metastasis to the paratesticular region (n = 6, 20%) and then primary malignant PTTs (n = 3, 10%). The commonest benign PTT was lipoma (n = 16, 76.19%), followed by adenomatoid tumor (n = 3, 14.28%) with one case each (4.76%) of cellular angiofibroma and hemangioma. Among primary malignant PTT, there were two cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, and one case of biphasic malignant mesothelioma. Metastatic tumors included four cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, and one case each of pancreatic signet ring cell carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PTTs show a wide clinicopathological spectrum. Benign PTTs are commoner than malignant PTTs. Meticulous grossing and histopathological examination supplemented by IHC is essential for an accurate diagnosis of this heterogenous class of tumors, which influences the role of adjuvant therapy and patient prognosis.</p>

<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habit. This condition is one of the most frequent reasons to seek a gastroenterology consultation in primary and secondary care. The diagnosis of IBS is made by identifying characteristic symptoms, as defined by the Rome criteria, and excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases that might otherwise explain these symptoms. Organic conditions that can be mistaken for IBS include coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and, in those with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms, chronic gastrointestinal infections, microscopic colitis, and primary bile acid diarrhoea. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth being associated with IBS is shrouded with controversy and uncertainty, mainly because of invalid tests due to poor sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions. There is insufficient evidence to link IBS-type symptoms with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, since both are hampered by conflicting data. Finally, there is growing appreciation that IBS can present in patients with known but stable organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as quiescent IBD or coeliac disease. Recognising functional gut symptoms in these individuals is paramount so that potentially harmful escalations in immunosuppressive therapy can be avoided and attention can be focused on addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction. This Review endeavours to aid clinicians who practise adult gastroenterology in recognising the potential overlap between IBS and organic gastrointestinal diseases and highlights areas in need of further research and clarity.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The worldwide prevalence and incidence of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) have been increasing recently, although few studies have analyzed data on the current situation of NENs in Japan. Here, the Japan Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (JNETS) planned to investigate the recent incidence and distribution of these tumors using data from the national cancer registry started in 2016. This study examined the incidence and distribution of primary sites as well as rate of advanced disease from this population-based registry. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A retrospective, population-based study using data from the national cancer registry in Japan (NCR) was conducted to evaluate patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic NEN (GEP-NEN) in 2016. Associated population data were used to determine annual age-adjusted incidences. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 6735 individuals were diagnosed with GEP-NEN in Japan in 2016. Annual onset incidence was 0.70/100,000 for pancreatic NEN and 2.84/100,000 for gastrointestinal NEN. NEN in the ileum accounted for only 1% of total GEP-NENs in Japan. Most NENs in the esophagus or lungs were neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), while the majority of those in the duodenum, ileum, appendix and rectum were grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Median age at initial diagnosis was in between 60 to 65. Tumors in the duodenum, appendix and rectum were mostly limited to local, while those in the esophagus, stomach and colon tended to show distant metastasis. In Japan, initial treatment for GEP-NENs was resection even if the tumor was NEC. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This is the first report of a national registry-based incidence and distribution of GEP-NEN in Japan. These data will serve as an important first step to determining the exact etiology and trends for this pathology in Japan.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with surgically unresectable cancer. As a result, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the most common biospecimen source available for diagnosis in treatment-naïve patients. Unfortunately, these limited samples are often not considered adequate for genomic analysis, precluding the opportunity for enrollment on precision medicine trials. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Applying an EpCAM-enrichment strategy, we show the feasibility of using real-world EUS-FNAs for in depth, molecular-barcoded, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis in 23 PDAC patients. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Potentially actionable mutations were identified in &gt;20% of patients. Further, an increased mutational burden and higher aneuploidy in WES data were associated with an adverse prognosis. To identify predictive biomarkers for first line chemotherapy, we developed an SCNA based complexity score (CS) that was associated with response to platinum-based regimens in this cohort. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Collectively, these results emphasize the feasibility of real-world cytology samples for in depth genomic characterization of PDAC and show the prognostic potential of SCNA for PDAC diagnosis.</p>

<p>Drug-induced pancreatitis is often mild to moderate in severity, but severe and even fatal cases can occur. Here, we report a 74-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for recurrent renal cell carcinoma, who presented with abdominal pain after administration of pazopanib following nivolumab and was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis. Administration of methylprednisolone and conservative treatment were initiated, but clinical findings and laboratory tests rapidly worsened. When she died, an autopsy was performed. The autopsy findings suggested the possibility of pancreatitis as immune-related adverse events. To the best of our knowledge, no fatal cases of acute pancreatitis due to nivolumab or pazopanib have been reported. We considered that the effects of nivolumab were sustained in the pancreas, and pazopanib administration might have worsened the toxicity.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To reappraise the optimal number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) in pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The well-established threshold of 15 ELN in PD for PDAC is optimized for detecting one positive node (PLN) per the previous 7 edition of the AJCC staging manual. In the framework of the 8 edition, where at least four PLN are needed for an N2 diagnosis, this threshold may be inadequate for accurate staging. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients who underwent upfront PD at two academic institutions between 2000 and 2016 were analyzed. The optimal ELN threshold was defined as the cut-point associated with a 95% probability of identifying at least 4 PLN in N2 patients. The results were validated addressing the N-status distribution and stage migration. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, 1218 patients were included. The median number of ELN was 26 (IQR 17-37). ELN was independently associated with N2-status (OR 1.27, p &lt; 0.001). The estimated optimal threshold of ELN was 28. This cut-point enabled improved detection of N2 patients and stage III disease (58% versus 37%, p = 0.001). The median survival was 28.6 months. There was an improved survival in N0/N1 patients when ELN exceeded 28, suggesting a stage migration effect (47 versus 29 months, adjusted HR 0.649, p &lt; 0.001). In N2 patients, this threshold was not associated with survival on multivariable analysis. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Examining at least 28 LN in PD for PDAC ensures optimal staging through improved detection of N2/stage III disease. This may have relevant implications for benchmarking processes and quality implementation.</p>

<p>Assessment of the Ki67 index is critical for grading well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs), which can show a broad range of labeling that defines the WHO grade (G1-G3). Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD-NECs) have a relatively high Ki67 index, &gt;20% in all cases and commonly exceeding 50%. After anecdotally observing PD-NECs with an unexpectedly low and heterogeneous Ki67 index following chemotherapy in 5 cases, we identified 15 additional cases of treated high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (HG-NENs). The study cohort comprised 20 cases; 11 PD-NECs, 8 mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 WD-NET, G3 from various anatomic sites (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and breast). The Ki67 index was evaluated on pretreatment (when available) and posttreatment samples. Topographic heterogeneity in the Ki67 index was expressed using a semi-quantitative score of 0 (no heterogeneity) to 5 (&gt;80% difference between maximal Ki67 and minimal Ki67 indices). Relative to the pretreatment group (n=9, mean Ki67 of 86.3%, range 80% to 100%), the neoplasms in the posttreatment group (n=20, mean Ki67 of 47.7%, range 1% to 90%) showed a significantly lower Ki67 index (18/20 cases). Of the 18 cases with a relatively low Ki67 index, 15 showed heterogeneous labeling (mean heterogeneity score of 2.3, range 1 to 5) and in 3 cases it was a homogeneously low. This phenomenon was observed in all subtypes of HG-NENs. In 6 cases, the alterations in Ki67 index following treatment were sufficient to place these HG-NENs in the WHO G1 or G2 grade, erroneously suggesting a diagnosis of WD-NET, and in 9 cases there was sufficient heterogeneity in the Ki67 index to suggest that a limited biopsy may sample an area of low Ki67, even though hotspot regions with a Ki67 index of &gt;20% persisted. In 7 cases, the alterations in the Ki67 index were accompanied by morphologic features resembling a WD-NET. These observations suggest that there is a potential for misinterpretation of previously treated PD-NECs as WD-NETs, or for assigning a lower grade in G3 WD-NETs. While the prognostic significance of treatment-associated alterations in Ki67 index is unknown, awareness of this phenomenon is important to avoid this diagnostic pitfall when evaluating treated NENs.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in the treatment of microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumors was recently reported. Therefore, the acquisition of histological specimens is desired in cases of unresectable solid pancreatic lesions (UR SPLs). This study investigated the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) using a Franseen needle for UR SPL tissue acquisition and MSI evaluation. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 195 SPL patients who underwent EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or EUS-FNB (EUS-FNAB) between January 2017 and March 2020 were enrolled in this study. Among them, 89 SPL patients (FNB: 28, FNA: 61) underwent EUS-FNAB using a 22-G needle (UR SPLs: 58, FNB: 22, FNA: 36) (UR SPLs after starting MSI evaluation: 23, FNB: 9, FNA: 14). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The puncture number was significantly lower with FNB than with FNA (median (range): 3 (2-5) vs 4 (1-8), P &lt;  0.01, UR SPLs: 3 (2-5) vs 4 (1-8), P = 0.036). Histological specimen acquisition was more commonly achieved with FNB than with FNA (92.9% (26/28) vs 68.9% (42/61), P = 0.015, UR SPLs: 100% (22/22) vs 72.2% (26/36), P &lt;  0.01). The histological specimen required for MSI evaluation was acquired more often with FNB than with FNA (88.9% (8/9) vs 35.7% (5/14), P = 0.03). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:EUS-FNB using a Franseen needle is efficient for histological specimen acquisition and sampling the required amount of specimen for MSI evaluation in UR SPL patients.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is increasingly being used in the management of patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); however, there is a lack of evidence regarding the benefit among these patients. Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to evaluate overall survival (OS) in PDAC patients with resectable disease treated with NAT or upfront resection through instrumental variable (IV) analysis. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A national cohort study of resectable PDAC patients in the National Cancer Data Base (2007-2015) treated with either upfront surgery or resection after NAT. Using multivariable modeling and IV methods, OS was compared between those treated with NAT and upfront resection. The IV was hospital-level NAT utilization in the most recent year prior to treatment. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The cohort included 16,666 patients (14,012 upfront resection; 2654 NAT) treated at 779 hospitals. Among those treated with upfront resection, 59.9% received any adjuvant therapy. NAT patients had higher median (27.9 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] 26.2-29.1) and 5-year OS (24.1%, 95% CI 21.9-26.3%) compared with those treated with upfront surgery (median 21.2 months, 95% CI 20.7-21.6; 5-year survival 20.9%, 95% CI 20.1-21.7%). After multivariable modeling, NAT was associated with an approximately 20% decrease in the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.84), and this effect was magnified in the IV analysis (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47-0.79). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In patients with resectable PDAC, NAT is associated with improved survival relative to upfront resection. Given the benefits of multimodality therapy and the challenges in receiving adjuvant therapy, consideration should be given to treating all PDAC patients with NAT.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The intestinal microbiome affects the prevalence and pathophysiology of a variety of diseases ranging from inflammation to cancer. A reduced taxonomic or functional diversity of the microbiome was often observed in association with poorer health outcomes or disease in general. Conversely, factors or manifest diseases that determine the long-term stability or instability of the microbiome are largely unknown. We aimed to identify disease-relevant phenotypes associated with faecal microbiota (in-)stability. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 2564 paired faecal samples from 1282 participants of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were collected at a 5-year (median) interval and microbiota profiles determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The changes in faecal microbiota over time were associated with highly standardised and comprehensive phenotypic data to determine factors related to microbiota (in-)stability. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The overall microbiome landscape remained remarkably stable over time. The greatest microbiome instability was associated with factors contributing to metabolic syndrome such as fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus. These, in turn, were associated with an increase in facultative pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae or Escherichia/Shigella. Greatest stability of the microbiome was determined by higher initial alpha diversity, female sex, high household income and preserved exocrine pancreatic function. Participants who newly developed fatty liver disease or diabetes during the 5-year follow-up already displayed significant microbiota changes at study entry when the diseases were absent. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study identifies distinct components of metabolic liver disease to be associated with instability of the intestinal microbiome, increased abundance of facultative pathogens and thus greater susceptibility toward dysbiosis-associated diseases.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Disconnectedpancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS), a severe complication of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP), may require surgery, usually by distal splenopancreatectomy, thus increasing the risk of diabetes. We describe a new technique reconnecting the distal pancreas to the digestive tract. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This technique was proposed after failure of non-surgical treatment and at least 3 months after the onset of ANP in non-diabetic or non-insulin dependent diabetic patients with a distal pancreas of at least 5 cm. The ruptured zone was identified and the distal side was anastomosed to the stomach or the jejunum. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:From 2013 to June 2019, 36 patients (median age = 49 years) with DPDS underwent a “French reconnection” procedure, indicated for chronic pain/recurrent pancreatitis (n = 35; 97%), persistent pancreatic fistula (n = 33; 91%), or digestive compression/fistulisation (n = 9; 25%). Median preoperative weight loss was 10 kg (4-27), the median number of hospitalisations per patient was 5(1-8) and 24(67%) patients had received endoscopic/percutaneous treatment. Surgery was performed in median 279(90-2000) days after ANP, laparoscopically in 9(25%) patients. The remnant pancreas (median length = 70 mm; range = 50-130) was anastomosed to the stomach (n = 30) or the jejunum (n = 6). There were 13(36%) postoperative grade B/C pancreatic fistulas and 3(10%) bleedings including one death (mortality = 3%). The median hospital stay was 18 (7-121) days. After a median follow-up of 24 (4-53) months, all pancreatic fistulas had healed and the clinical success rate was 91%. Median BMI increased from 22 to 25 kg/m2. In patients with normal pancreatic function, postoperative de novo endocrine and severe exocrine insufficiencies were observed in 4/27 (15%) and 7/22 (32%), respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The “French reconnection” procedure, as an alternative to distal splenopancreatectomy for the treatment of DPDS, provides good control of symptoms and decreases the risk of pancreatic insufficiency.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To explore the clinicopathologic features and differential diagnosis of breast primary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (MCA). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Pathological characteristics and immunophenotype of one case of MCA were analyzed. Literature was reviewed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Grossly, the area of the tumor cut surface was gelationous. Microscopcally, the tumor was composed of variably sized cystic spaces lined by mucus-rich tumor cells with single columnar, stratified appearance and papillary formation. The degree of cytologic atypia varied from region to region. The tumor cells were positive for CK7, GATA3, negative for CK20, ER, PR and HER2. Most peripheral myoepithelial cells were negative for P63 and SMMHC. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:MCA is a rare primary breast cancer and strikingly similar to ovarian, pancreatic and gastrointestinal counterparts. The diagnosis cannot be made until the metastatic lesion is ruled out. On the other hand, the biologic behavior of MCA is reportedly favorable despite a high proliferation index and triple negative biomarker status. Therefore, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation is questionable.</p>

<p>Apical microvilli of polarized epithelial cells govern the absorption of metabolites and the transport of fluid in tissues. Previously, we reported that tall and dense basal microvilli present on the endothelial cells of pancreatic cancers, a lethal malignancy with a high metabolism and unusual hypomicrovascularity, contain nutrient trafficking vesicles and glucose; their length and density were related to the glucose uptake of pancreatic cancers in a small-scale analysis. However, the implications of basal microvilli on pancreatic cancers are unknown. Here, we evaluated the clinical implications of basal microvilli in 106 pancreatic cancers. We found that basal microvilli are a dominant change in pancreatic cancers. The presence of longer and denser basal microvilli on the microvessels in pancreatic cancer tissues positively correlated with increased glucose uptake and higher metastatic (or invasive) and proliferative potentials of neoplastic cells and vice versa. Clinically, postoperative patients with longer and denser basal microvilli were more prone to unfavorable pathological characteristics and dismal prognoses. They were even more refractory to adjuvant therapy than those with shorter and thinner basal microvilli were. Our findings show that basal microvilli define the metabolic capacity and lethal phenotype of pancreatic cancers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pain in chronic pancreatitis is subdivided in a continuous or intermittent pattern, each thought to represent a different entity, requiring specific treatment. Because evidence is missing, we studied pain patterns in a prospective longitudinal nationwide study. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:1131 patients with chronic pancreatitis (fulfilling M-ANNHEIM criteria) were included between 2011 and 2018 in 30 Dutch hospitals. Patients with continuous or intermittent pain were compared for demographics, pain characteristics, quality of life (Short-Form 36), imaging findings, disease duration and treatment. Alternation of pain pattern and associated variables were longitudinally assessed using a multivariable multinomial logistic regression model. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:At inclusion, 589 patients (52%) had continuous pain, 231 patients (20%) had intermittent pain and 311 patients (28%) had no pain. Patients with continuous pain had more severe pain, used more opioids and neuropathic pain medication, and had a lower quality of life. There were no differences between pain patterns for morphological findings on imaging, disease duration and treatment. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 552 of 905 patients (61%) alternated at least once between pain patterns. All alternations were associated with the Visual Analogue Scale pain intensity score and surgery was only associated with the change from pain to no pain. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Continuous and intermittent pain patterns in chronic pancreatitis do not seem to be the result of distinctly different pathophysiological entities. The subjectively reported character of pain is not related to imaging findings or disease duration. Pain patterns often change over time and are merely a feature of how severity of pain is experienced.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to assess the impact of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) on patient disease-specific survival and recurrence after curative distal pancreatectomy (DP) for pancreatic cancer. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This was a retrospective case-control analysis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We examined the data of adult patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) of the body and tail of the pancreas undergoing curative DP, over a 10-year period in 12 European surgical departments, from a prospectively implemented database. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among the 382 included patients, 283 met the strict inclusion criteria; 139 were males (49.1%) and the median age of the entire population was 70 years (range 37-88). A total of 121 POPFs were observed (42.8%), 42 (14.9%) of which were CR-POPFs. The median follow-up period was 24 months (range 3-120). Although poorer in the POPF group, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) did not differ significantly between patients with and without CR-POPF (p = 0.224 and p = 0.165, respectively). CR-POPF was not significantly associated with local or peritoneal recurrence (p = 0.559 and p = 0.302, respectively). A smaller percentage of patients benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy after POPF (76.2% vs. 83.8%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.228). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:CR-POPF is a major complication after DP but it did not affect the postoperative therapeutic path or long-term oncologic outcomes. CR-POPF was not a predictive factor for disease recurrence and was not associated with an increased incidence of peritoneal or local relapse.

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION”:The impact of glycemic status and insulin resistance on the risk of pancreatic cancer in the nondiabetic population remains uncertain. We aimed to examine the association of glycemic status and insulin resistance with pancreatic cancer mortality in individuals with and without diabetes. Label=“METHODS”:This is a cohort study of 572,021 Korean adults without cancer at baseline, who participated in repeat screening examinations which included fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin, and were followed for a median of 8.4 years (interquartile range, 5.3 -13.2 years). Vital status and pancreatic cancer mortality were ascertained through linkage to national death records. Label=“RESULTS”:During 5,211,294 person-years of follow-up, 260 deaths from pancreatic cancer were identified, with a mortality rate of 5.0 per 10 person-years. In the overall population, the risk of pancreatic cancer mortality increased with increasing levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c in a dose-response manner, and this association was observed even in individuals without diabetes. In nondiabetic individuals without previously diagnosed or screen-detected diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were positively associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality. Specifically, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for pancreatic cancer mortality comparing the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.49 (1.08-2.05), and the corresponding hazard ratio comparing the insulin ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.43 (1.05-1.95). These associations remained significant when introducing changes in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and other confounders during follow-up as time-varying covariates. Label=“DISCUSSION”:Glycemic status, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, even in individuals without diabetes, were independently associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Our objective was to examine the associations between early discharge and readmission after major abdominal operations. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Advances in patient care resulted in earlier patient discharge after complex abdominal operations. Whether early discharge is associated with patient readmissions remains controversial. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients who had colorectal, liver, and pancreas operations abstracted in 2011-2017 ACS NSQIP Participant Use Data Files were included. Patient readmission was stratified by 6 operative groups. Patients who were discharged prior to median discharge date within each operative group were categorized as an early discharge. Analyses tested associations between early discharge and likelihood of 30-day postoperative unplanned readmission. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:364,609 patients with major abdominal operations were included. Individual patient groups and corresponding median day of discharge were: laparoscopic colectomy (n = 152,575; median = 4), open colectomy (n = 137,462; median = 7), laparoscopic proctectomy (n = 12,238; median = 5), open proctectomy (n = 24,925; median = 6), major hepatectomy (n = 9,805; median = 6), pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 27,604; median = 8). Early discharge was not associated with an increase in proportion of readmissions in any operative group. Early discharge was associated with a decrease in average proportion of patient readmissions compared to patients discharged on median date in each of the operative groups: laparoscopic colectomy 6% versus 8%, open colectomy 11% versus 14%, laparoscopic proctectomy 13% versus 16%, open proctectomy 13% vs 17%, major hepatectomy 8% versus 12%, pancreatoduodenectomy 16% versus 20% (all p ≤ 0.02). Serious morbidity composite was significantly lower in patients who were discharged early than those who were not in each operative group (all p &lt; 0.001). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Early discharge in selected patients after major abdominal operations is associated with lower, and not higher, rate of 30-day unplanned readmission.</p>

Obesity-related cancers included breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for important predictors of survival. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:After a median follow-up of 10.0 years from the date of the cancer diagnosis, there were 3607 total deaths, with 1546 (43%) due to cancer. Most participants (62.9%) had 1 or 2 cardiometabolic risk factors, and 8.1% had 3 or 4. In adjusted models, women with 3 to 4 risk factors (vs none) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.73-2.30), death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.88-5.57), cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.1-1.72), and other-cause mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.70-2.69). A higher waist circumference was associated with greater all-cause mortality (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among postmenopausal women diagnosed with cancer in the WHI, cardiometabolic risk factors before the cancer diagnosis were associated with greater all-cause, CVD, cancer-specific, and other-cause mortality. These results raise hypotheses regarding potential clinical intervention strategies targeting cardiometabolic abnormalities that require future prospective studies for confirmation. Label=“LAY SUMMARY” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:This study uses information from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) to find out whether cardiac risk factors are related to a greater risk of dying among older women with cancer. The WHI is the largest study of medical problems faced by older women in this country. The results show that women who have 3 or 4 risk factors are more likely to die of any cause, heart disease, or cancer in comparison with women with no risk factors. It is concluded that interventions to help to lower the burden of cardiac risk factors can have an important impact on survivorship among women with cancer.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Endoscopic necrosectomy has emerged as the preferred treatment modality for walled-off pancreatic necrosis. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct endoscopic necrosectomy with and without hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) lavage. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Retrospective chart reviews were performed for all patients undergoing endoscopic transmural management of walled-off pancreatic necrosis at 9 major medical centers from November 2011 to August 2018. Clinical success was defined as the resolution of the collection by imaging within 6 months, without requiring non-endoscopic procedures or surgery. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 293 patients, 204 met the inclusion criteria. Technical and clinical success rates were 100% (204/204) and 81% (166/189), respectively. For patients, 122 (59.8%) patients had at least one H2O2 necrosectomy (H2O2 group) and 82 (40.2%) patients had standard endoscopic necrosectomy. Clinical success was higher in the H2O2 group: 106/113 (93.8%) vs 60/76 (78.9%), P = 0.002. On a multivariate analysis, the use of H2O2 was associated with higher clinical success rate (odds ratio 3.30, P = 0.033) and earlier resolution (odds ratio 2.27, P &lt; 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 274 days, 27 complications occurred. Comparing procedures performed with and without H2O2 (n = 250 vs 183), there was no difference in post-procedure bleeding (7 vs 9, P = 0.25), perforation (2 vs 3, P = 0.66), infection (1 vs 2, P = 0.58), or overall complication rate (n = 13 [5.2%] vs 14 [7.7%], P = 0.30). Label=“DISCUSSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:H2O2-assisted endoscopic necrosectomy had a higher clinical success rate and a shorter time to resolution with equivalent complication rates relative to standard necrosectomy.See the visual abstract at <a href="http://links.lww.com/AJG/B714" class="uri">http://links.lww.com/AJG/B714</a>.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a novel, laparoscopic intraperitoneal chemotherapy delivery technique aiming to improve drug distribution and tissue penetration to treat peritoneal metastases. Thus far, PIPAC oxaliplatin is conducted at an arbitrary dose of 92mg/m2. We conducted a phase 1 study to establish safety and tolerability. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We used a 3+3 dose escalation design of PIPAC oxaliplatin for patients with peritoneal metastases from gastrointestinal tumors, after failure of at least first-line chemotherapy. Dose levels were planned at 45, 60, 90 and 120mg/m2. Label=“FINDINGS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:This study included 16 patients with 24 PIPAC procedures (8 gastric, 5 colorectal and 1 gallbladder, pancreas and appendix cancer each). Median age and Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score were 62 years and 17, respectively. Two patients developed pancreatitis (grade 2 and 3) at 45mg/m2, necessitating cohort expansion. Another patient developed grade 2 pancreatitis at 90mg/m2. There were no other dose limiting toxicities and the highest dose cohort (120 mg/m2) tolerated PIPAC well. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated good linearity between dose and maximum concentration (r2=0.95) and area under the curve (AUC) (r2=0.99). Based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, 62.5% and 50% had stable disease after one and two PIPAC procedures, respectively. 8 patients underwent 2 PIPAC procedures, with improvement of median PCI and Peritoneal Regression Grade Score from 15 to 12 and 2.5 to 2.0, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The recommended phase 2 dose is 120 mg/m2. Future studies should further delineate the efficacy and role of PIPAC oxaliplatin for peritoneal metastases.</p>

<p>Label=“AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Breast neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) constitute a rare histologic subtype of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and their definition according to the WHO classification was revised in 2019. Breast NETs display histologic and transcriptomic similarities with mucinous breast carcinomas (MuBCs). Here, we sought to compare the repertoire of genetic alterations in breast NETs with MuBCs and NETs from other anatomic origins. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:On histologic review applying the new WHO criteria, 18 breast tumours with neuroendocrine differentiation were reclassified as breast NETs (n=10) or other breast cancers with neuroendocrine differentiation (n=8). We reanalysed targeted sequencing or whole-exome sequencing data of breast NETs (n=10), MuBCs type A (n=12) and type B (n=11). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Breast NETs and MuBCs were found to be genetically similar, harbouring a lower frequency of PIK3CA mutations, 1q gains and 16q losses than ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. 3/10 breast NETs harboured the hallmark features of ER-positive disease (ie, PIK3CA mutations and concurrent 1q gains/16q losses). Breast NETs showed an enrichment of oncogenic/likely oncogenic mutations affecting transcription factors compared with common forms of ER-positive breast cancer and with pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Breast NETs are heterogeneous and are characterised by an enrichment of mutations in transcription factors and likely constitute a spectrum of entities histologically and genomically related to MuBCs. While most breast NETs are distinct from ER-positive/HER2-negative IDC-NSTs, a subset of breast NETs appears to be genetically similar to common forms of ER-positive breast cancer, suggesting that some breast cancers may acquire neuroendocrine differentiation later in tumour evolution.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with high mortality. Acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member E (ANP32E), a specific H2A.Z chaperone, has been shown to contribute to breast cancer development. However, the significance of ANP32E in pancreatic cancer is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of ANP32E in pancreatic cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The expression of ANP32E in 179 pancreatic cancer tissues and 171 normal tissues, and the correlation between ANP32E expression and patients’ survival were analyzed from the TCGA database. ANP32E was over-expressed and silenced using lentivirus. siRNA was used to knock down β-catenin. CCK8, colony formation, cell cycle and transwell experiments were performed to determine cell proliferation and migration. qRT-PCR and Western blot were conducted to detect mRNA and protein expression. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:ANP32E was up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Up-regulation of ANP32E predicted poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of ANP32E suppressed the proliferation, colony growth and migration of PANC1 and MIA cells. By contrast, ANP32E over-expression promoted the proliferation and migration of both cells. In addition, ANP32E accelerated the cell cycle progression in PANC1 and MIA cells. Molecular experiments showed that ANP32E activated β-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling. Silencing of β-catenin reduced cell proliferation and migration in ANP32E over-expressed cells. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our results propose that ANP32E functions as an oncogene in pancreatic cancer via activating β-catenin.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Higher socioeconomic status (SES) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) race/ethnicity are associated with higher treatment rates and longer overall survival (OS) among US patients with stage I-II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The proportion of OS disparities mediated through treatment disparities (PM) and the proportion predicted to be eliminated (PE) if treatment disparities were eliminated are unknown. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed 2007-2015 data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) census tract-level database and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) using causal mediation analysis methods to understand the extent to which treatment disparities mediate OS disparities. In the first set of decompositions, race/ethnicity was controlled for as a covariate proximal to SES, and lower SES strata were compared with the highest SES stratum. In the second set, an intersectional perspective was taken and each SES-race/ethnicity combination was compared with highest SES-NHW patients, who had the highest treatment rates and longest OS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The SEER and NCDB cohorts contained 16,921 patients and 44,638 patients, respectively. When race/ethnicity was controlled for, PMs ranged from 43 to 48% and PEs ranged from 46 to 50% for various lower SES strata. When separately comparing each SES-race/ethnicity combination with the highest SES-NHW patients, results were similar for lower SES-NHW patients but differed markedly for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients, for whom PMs ranged from 60 to 80% and PEs ranged from 55 to 75% for most lower SES strata. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:These results suggest that efforts to reduce treatment disparities are worthwhile, particularly for NHB and Hispanic patients, and simultaneously point to the importance of non-treatment-related causal pathways.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors have a nutrient-poor, desmoplastic, and highly innervated tumor microenvironment. Although neurons can release stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic contribution of peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal innervation using LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor growth. Our data indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical adaptation to support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study aims to define the role of surgery and assess different therapies for nonagenarians with localized, nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients ≥ 90 years of age with nonmetastatic, localized PDAC from 2004-2016. Postoperative mortality was assessed at 30 and 90 days in patients receiving pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy. Overall survival (OS) was compared between three treatment groups: surgery alone, chemotherapy alone, and chemoradiation (chemoRT) alone. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 380,524 patients with PDAC, 98 patients ≥ 90 years of age underwent curative-intent resection; 55% were female and 75% had a Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0. A total of 17% received postoperative chemotherapy, 51.1% had poorly differentiated tumors with a median tumor size of 3 cm, 55.1% had positive lymph nodes, and 19.4% had positive resection margins. Postoperative median length of stay was 11 days. Postoperative 30- and 90-day mortality was 10.0% and 18.9%, respectively. Median OS for the surgery alone group was 11.6 months compared with 20.4 months in those receiving adjuvant therapy (p = 0.01). Among nonoperative PDAC patients, median OS in patients receiving chemotherapy only (n = 207) was 7.2 months, while chemoRT only (n = 100) was similar to surgery only (11 versus 11.6 months, p = 0.97). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Even in well-selected nonagenarians, pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy carries a high mortality rate. While adjuvant therapy after resection provides the best survival, it is seldom achieved, and chemoRT alone affords identical survival statistics as surgery alone. These data suggest it is reasonable to consider chemoRT as initial therapy, then reassess candidacy for resection if performance status allows.</p>

<p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) controls metabolic organ homeostasis and eating/drinking behavior via FGF receptor 1/Klothoβ (FGFR1/KLB) complexes expressed in adipocytes, pancreatic acinar cells, and the nervous system in mice. Chronic administration of recombinant FGF21 or engineered variants improves metabolic health in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans; however, the rapid turnover of these molecules limits therapeutic utility. Here we show that the bispecific anti-FGFR1/KLB agonist antibody BFKB8488A induced marked weight loss in obese cynomolgus monkeys while elevating serum adiponectin and the adipose expression of FGFR1 target genes, demonstrating its action as an FGF21 mimetic. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study in overweight/obese human participants, subcutaneous BFKB8488A injection caused transient body weight reduction, sustained improvement in cardiometabolic parameters, and a trend toward reduction in preference for sweet taste and carbohydrate intake. These data suggest that specific activation of the FGFR1/KLB complex in humans can be used as therapy for obesity-related metabolic defects.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of subsequent primary neoplasms (SPNs), but the risk of developing specific digestive SPNs beyond age 40 years remains uncertain. We investigated risks of specific digestive SPNs within the largest available cohort worldwide. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The PanCareSurFup cohort includes 69 460 five-year survivors of childhood cancer from 12 countries in Europe. Risks of digestive SPNs were quantified using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks and cumulative incidence. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:427 digestive SPNs (214 colorectal, 62 liver, 48 stomach, 44 pancreas, 59 other) were diagnosed in 413 survivors. Wilms tumour (WT) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors were at greatest risk (SIR 12.1; 95% CI 9.6 to 15.1; SIR 7.3; 95% CI 5.9 to 9.0, respectively). The cumulative incidence increased the most steeply with increasing age for WT survivors, reaching 7.4% by age 55% and 9.6% by age 60 years (1.0% expected based on general population rates). Regarding colorectal SPNs, WT and HL survivors were at greatest risk; both seven times that expected. By age 55 years, 2.3% of both WT (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9) and HL (95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) survivors had developed a colorectal SPN-comparable to the risk among members of the general population with at least two first-degree relatives affected. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Colonoscopy surveillance before age 55 is recommended in many European countries for individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer, but not for WT and HL survivors despite a comparable risk profile. Clinically, serious consideration should be given to the implementation of colonoscopy surveillance while further evaluation of its benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness in WT and HL survivors is undertaken.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Majority of predictors of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) use intraoperative variables. We aimed to study the role of preoperative ultrasound shear wave elastography (USWE) to predict POPF. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) between January 2019 to March 2020 were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent USWE assessment at the pancreatic neck level. Intraoperative variables including pancreatic texture, pancreatic duct diameter, blood loss and histological grading of fibrosis were also recorded. Associations between USWE and intraoperative variables and histological grading with the development of POPF were analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 62 patients assessed, 50 patients (mean age: 53 ± 14 years; 31 males) were included. POPF and clinically relevant POPF (CRPOPF) were observed in 22 (44%) and 7 (14%) patients respectively. Soft pancreas was an independent predictor of CRPOPF (p = 0.04). The mean USWE valve was significantly lower in patients with CRPOPF as compared to no CRPOPF (9.7 Kpa vs. 12.8Kpa, p = 0.016). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, USWE value of 12.65Kpa yielded sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 47%, respectively, for prediction of CRPOPF. USWE showed significant correlation with intraoperative pancreatic texture (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) = 0.565, p = 0.001). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:USWE helps in preoperative prediction of CRPOPF. This may further help to customize management strategy in high risk patients.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This meta-analysis aims to explore the diagnostic value and accuracy of circulating lncRNAs as biomarkers of digestive system tumors. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science were searched for relevant articles that were published before April 2019, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:52 studies with 63 lncRNAs were discussed in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.77), respectively. The pooled DOR (the diagnostic odds ratio) was 15.63 (95% CI: 12.77-19.12), and the overall AUC (the area under the curve) was 0.87. Besides, subgroup analyzes showed that the DOR and AUC of large sample sizes (&gt;80), multiple lncRNAs, serum-based lncRNAs, and downregulation group were superior to those of small sample sizes (≤80), single lncRNA, plasma-based lncRNAs, and upregulation group, respectively. The current data also highlight that the diagnostic accuracy of circulating lncRNAs in the case of colorectal cancer was higher than gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. And there is no difference in the perspective of geographical regions. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The circulating lncRNAs have high diagnostic value and accuracy in digestive system cancers and may serve as potential biomarkers.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although 10% formalin is a standard preservative in pancreatic FNAs, the effect of CytoLyt on pancreatic tissue preservation has not been systematically explored. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Smears and cell blocks from CytoLyt-fixed (CF-CBs) and formalin-fixed (FF-CBs) pancreatic FNAs were blindly reviewed without knowledge of the fixative used, and the presence of tissue/tumor autolysis was noted. Controls included FF-CBs from pancreatic FNAs, CF-CBs from nonpancreatic FNAs, and 4 pancreatic FNAs with matched CF-CBs and FF-CBs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found that 62 of 85 (73%) pancreatic FNAs with CF-CBs showed significant autolysis, which was most pronounced in acinar cells and/or tumor cells with benign acinar cells in the background, compared with 2 of 46 (4%) FF-CBs (P &lt; .0001) and 3 of 26 (12%) CF-CBs from nonpancreatic FNAs (73% vs 12%; P &lt; .0001). Of the 4 pancreatic FNAs with matched CF-CBs and FF-CBs, all 4 CF-CBs showed marked autolysis versus none of the matched FF-CBs. Of the 23 (27%) pancreatic FNAs with CF-CBs that did not show autolysis, 10 had no acinar cells, and 7 had only minute tissue fragments on CB. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:While CytoLyt is a useful fixative for nonpancreatic FNAs it is a suboptimal fixative for pancreatic FNAs and is associated with tissue/tumor autolysis in the majority of cases, influencing morphologic evaluation, and potentially immunocytochemical staining. Autolysis appears to be due to acinar enzymes whose effect is likely interrupted/inhibited by formalin fixation. Cytopathologists and cytotechnologists should be mindful of this pitfall and should avoid using CytoLyt as a fixative for pancreatic FNAs.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Disparities in pancreatic cancer outcomes between black and white patients are well documented. This study aimed to use a more novel index to examine the impact of racial segregation on the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of pancreatic cancer in black patients compared with white patients. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Black and white adults with pancreatic cancer in urban counties were identified using data from the 2018 submission of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program and the 2010 Census. The racial index of dissimilarity (IoD), a validated proxy of racial segregation, was used to assess the evenness with which whites and blacks are distributed across census tracts in each county. Multivariate Poisson regression was performed, and stepwise models were constructed for each of the outcomes. Overall survival was studied using the Kaplan-Meier method. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The study enrolled 60,172 adults with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer between 2005 and 2015. Overall, the black patients (13.8% of the cohort) lived in more segregated areas (IoD, 0.67 vs 0.61; p &lt; 0.05). They were less likely to undergo surgery for localized disease (relative risk [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.83) and more frequently had a diagnosis of advanced-stage disease (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19) with increasing segregation. They also had shorter survival times (9.8 vs 11.4 months; p &lt; 0.05). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Disparities in advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, surgery for localized disease, and overall survival are directly related to the degree of residential segregation, a proxy for structural racism. In searching for solutions to this problem, it is important to account for the historical marginalization of black Americans.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Black Americans are at increased risk of chronic pancreatitis (CP) compared to their White counterparts. We aimed to describe the race-specific smoking history and lifetime drinking in patients diagnosed with CP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed data on 334 Black and White CP participants of the North American Pancreatitis Study 2 Continuation and Validation Study and Ancillary Study. Lifetime drinking history and lifetime smoking history were collected through in-person interviews. Intensity, frequency, duration and current status of drinking and smoking were compared between Black and White CP participants, stratified by physician-defined alcohol etiology. In addition, drinking levels at each successive decades in life (20s, 30s, 40s) were compared by race and graphically portrayed as heat diagrams. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among patients with alcoholic CP, current smoking levels were not different by race (67-70%), but a smaller proportion of Black patients reported having smoked 1 or more packs per day in the past (32%) as compared to White patients (58%, p &lt; 0.0001). Black patients were more likely to report current consumption of alcohol (31%), as opposed to White patients (17%, p = 0.016). Black patients also reported more intense drinking at age 35 and 45 years as compared to White patients, while age at CP onset were similar between the two groups. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We found more intense drinking but less intense smoking history in Black CP patients as compared to White CP patients. Effective alcohol abstinence and smoking cessation program with sustained impact are needed in CP patients.</p>

<p>At 2:00 h on Oct 31, 1920, Frederick G Banting, a surgeon practising in London, ON, Canada, conceived an idea to isolate the internal secretion of the pancreas. The following week, he met with noted scientist John J R Macleod in Toronto, ON, Canada, and they developed a research plan. By August, 1921, Banting and his student assistant Charles H Best had prepared an effective extract from a canine pancreas. In January, 1922, biochemist James B Collip isolated insulin that was sufficiently pure for human use. On Oct 25, 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin. Here, we recount the most relevant events before and after the fateful early morning of Oct 31, 1920, which culminated in the discovery and clinical use of insulin.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The classification of epithelioid pancreatic neoplasms based on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is important for proper management, as distinction of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms from other similar appearing lesions can result in significantly different treatment. Mixed acinar-endocrine carcinomas (MAEC) are genetically related to acinar carcinomas and are treated as such. We reviewed cases of MAEC to better characterize their cytologic and immunohistochemical features. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Eight FNAs of MAECs were identified and reviewed. A chart review for each case was conducted. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:All patients were male, 42-68 years of age, and presented with either Stage 3 or 4 disease. Smear backgrounds of all cases showed naked nuclei without significant necrosis. The smears were cellular with cells arranged in either three-dimensional (3D) clusters with intervening capillaries or singly dispersed. Acinar formation was a prominent feature. Cells were round to oval with small to moderate amounts of delicate cytoplasm. The nuclei were round to oval with mild to moderate anisonucleosis with granular chromatin and small nucleoli. Apoptotic bodies and mitoses were noted in most cases, with Ki67 indices of 10%-48%. All tumors, by definition, demonstrated expression of trypsin and synaptophysin with variable chromogranin expression (50%). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The cytology of acinar cell carcinoma shares features with aspirates of other nonductal adenocarcinoma neoplasms of the pancreas. A clue to the diagnosis is that tumors show high Ki67 indices and a diagnosis of MAEC should be excluded anytime a diagnosis of Grade 2 or 3 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma is in the differential.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The clinical implications of pre- and postoperative KRAS-mutated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) present in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have remained an unresolved issue. This study sought to investigate the clinical significance of pre- and postoperative ctDNA analyses and their impact on the prognosis of PDAC patients. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction detected ctDNA in pre- and postoperative plasma samples prospectively obtained from patients with resectable and borderline-resectable PDAC. Its associations with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. The patients were sorted according to the presence of pre- and postoperative ctDNA, and its ability to stratify prognosis was evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The study analyzed 97 patients. Both pre- and postoperative ctDNA were detected in 9 patients, and neither was detected in 55 patients. Whereas 15 patients harbored only preoperative ctDNA, 18 patients had only postoperative ctDNA. The multivariate analysis showed that the presence of preoperative ctDNA was associated with poorer OS (P = 0.008) and that postoperative ctDNA was not associated with either RFS or OS. Survival did not differ significantly between the patients with a positive shift in ctDNA status and those without detectable pre- or postoperative ctDNA. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:For the patients with PDAC, the presence of preoperative ctDNA was significantly associated poor OS, whereas postoperative ctDNA was not associated with poor survival. A positive change in ctDNA did not affect patients’ survival.</p>

<p>Inhibition of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in combination with blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 T cell checkpoint induces T cell infiltration and anticancer responses in murine and human pancreatic cancer. Here we elucidate the mechanism by which CXCR4 inhibition affects the tumor immune microenvironment. In human immune cell-based chemotaxis assays, we find that CXCL12-stimulated CXCR4 inhibits the directed migration mediated by CXCR1, CXCR3, CXCR5, CXCR6, and CCR2, respectively, chemokine receptors expressed by all of the immune cell types that participate in an integrated immune response. Inhibiting CXCR4 in an experimental cancer medicine study by 1-wk continuous infusion of the small-molecule inhibitor AMD3100 (plerixafor) induces an integrated immune response that is detected by transcriptional analysis of paired biopsies of metastases from patients with microsatellite stable colorectal and pancreatic cancer. This integrated immune response occurs in three other examples of immune-mediated damage to noninfected tissues: Rejecting renal allografts, melanomas clinically responding to anti-PD1 antibody therapy, and microsatellite instable colorectal cancers. Thus, signaling by CXCR4 causes immune suppression in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer by impairing the function of the chemokine receptors that mediate the intratumoral accumulation of immune cells.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although rapid progress has been achieved in laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) over the last decade, laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (LDPPHR) remains a challenging surgery that has been rarely reported due to not only requiring complicated pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) but also ensuring sufficient blood supplies to duodenum and common bile duct (CBD). We completed LDPPHR for 22 patients safely and efficiently with innovative techniques. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Clinical outcomes, including rate of conversion to laparotomy, time of residual pancreatic duct reconstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, and time of hospital stay, were collected for 22 consecutive patients who underwent LDPPHR with innovative techniques as follows: application of indocyanine green (ICG) to visualize and preserve CBD and the vessels supplying the duodenum and CBD, Hong’s PJ, and pancreatic duct end-to-end anastomosis (ETEA) for the residual pancreas. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:All surgeries were performed successfully under laparoscopy except for one case. The duration of ETEA was significantly shorter than PJ (18.2 ± 5.1 min versus 27.5 ± 8.3 min, p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in incidence of postoperative complications between the Hong’s PJ and ETEA group. The overall incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) in the Hong’s PJ and ETEA group was 23.5% and 20%, respectively, without grade C fistula. All complications were resolved after conservative treatment. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:By utilizing intraoperative ICG navigation, LDPPHR is a minimally invasive, safe, and efficient approach for chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic head stones by using pancreatic duct ETEA and benign or low-grade malignant tumors of the pancreatic head by using Hong’s PJ.</p>

<p>Pancreatic neurogenic tumors, including schwannoma and neurofibroma, are rare, and their genetic aberrances have not been defined. The present study aimed at investigating the genomic alterations of pancreatic schwannoma and neurofibroma. Two patients with pancreatic schwannoma and 1 patient with neurofibroma, who underwent surgical resection at the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between June 2016 and April 2019, were recruited into the study. Their tumor tissues were analyzed by exome sequencing and genome sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed a MUTYH likely pathogenic germline variant in 1 schwannoma with somatic NF2del and NOTCH1 amplification. Pathway enrichment analysis on the other schwannoma case showed that the main abnormal function involved DNA damage repair, mitosis, and cell cycle. In addition, genome sequencing showed the inversion (INV) variant of SPIRE gene and multiple mitochondrial INV variants in both schwannoma cases. Furthermore, exome sequencing revealed NF1del, single nucleotide variation, TP53, and ERBB3 amplification in neurofibroma, whereas genomic duplication/deletion variants and mitochondrial abnormalities were much less than that in schwannoma. In conclusion, variants in NF1 and NF2 genes, amplification of key driver genes, and somatic and mitochondrial INV variants may play important roles in the development of pancreatic schwannoma and neurofibroma.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cystic insulinoma is an uncommon tumor. Perioperative localization remained challenging if the tumor is atypical with cystic feature or in small size. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is a technique by injecting fluorescent dye intravenously, which accumulates to the target lesion and creating signal by laser sources. The signal helps surgeons to identify the lesion during operation, but little experience has been reported regarding the use of imaging NIR technique for localizing cystic insulinoma. We present a 29-year-old female patient with a symptomatic pancreatic cystic insulinoma (1.2 cm) as assessed by clinical symptom, laboratory evidence, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. With an aid of NIR imaging technique, this cystic tumor was localized easily at operation. Also, the fluorescence imaging visualized the tumor part, guided us to identify the safe margin, and preserved the normal pancreatic structure. Pathologic report confirmed that the tumor was a well-differentiated cystic insulinoma. This case demonstrates that pancreatic cystic insulinoma in small size can be intraoperatively localized by NIR imaging, a relatively safe and easy technique.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:In 2017 and 2019, the World Health Organization defined grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors (G3 NETs) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (G3 NEC) in the pancreas. The validity of this classification remains to be verified. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Clinical data were collected and analyzed for 39 G3 pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) patients between 2009 and 2018. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The tumor-node-metastasis stage (P = 0.0260), differentiation (P = 0.0115), and Ki-67 index (P = 0.0371) are prognostic factors for G3 PanNENs by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Among 39 patients, 18 had a Ki-67 index of less than 55% and well-differentiated morphology (G3 NET) and 16 had a Ki-67 index of 55% or greater and poorly differentiated morphology (G3 NEC). Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumor had a significant better prognosis than G3 NEC (median overall survival time, 25 months [95% confidence interval, 10.854-39.146 months] vs 12 months [95% confidence interval, 6.316-17.684 months], P = 0.0164). Based on Cox regression analyses, tumor-node-metastasis stage (P = 0.016) was identified as the independent prognostic factor for G3 PanNENs. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The upper Ki-67 index cutoff of 55% might be the best cutoff value to define G3 NETs and G3 NECs for G3 PanNENs. The World Health Organization 2017 and 2019 classification system for G3 PanNENs can identify high-risk patients with G3 PanNENs.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The multidrug regimen with fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is widely used for recurrent pancreatic cancer after pancreatic resection. However, there are concerns about severe toxicities and poor tolerability of FOLFIRINOX in these patients because some suffer from surgery-associated malnutrition, weight loss, and diabetes mellitus. We evaluated the toxicity and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX in these patients. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This study was conducted as a secondary analysis of the Japan Adjuvant Study Group of Pancreatic Cancer 06 study, which was a multicenter observational study of FOLFIRINOX for pancreatic cancer in Japan. The toxicity and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX in recurrent disease correlated with those of both the locally advanced and the metastatic disease group. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The major grades 3 and 4 toxicities observed in the recurrent and locally advanced or metastatic disease groups were neutropenia (68% vs 63%), febrile neutropenia (4% vs 15%, P = 0.007), thrombocytopenia (4% vs 3%), diarrhea (4% vs 8%), and sensory neuropathy (0% vs 2%). The dose modification and relative dose intensity did not differ markedly between the groups.

Immunohistochemical staining for lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) was performed on 59 resected PDAC tumors annotated for clinical outcome. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Galloflavin reduced PDAC proliferation in monoculture (P &lt; 0.01); however, in co-culture with PSCs, an antiproliferative effect was only evident in PANC-1 (P = 0.001). An apoptotic effect was observed in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 in coculture (P &lt; 0.05). A reduction in media lactate was observed in coculture (P &lt; 0.01) with PSCs. Immunohistochemistry revealed stromal and tumoral LDHB expression had no impact on survival. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Galloflavin has the potential to neutralize the acidic PDAC microenvironment and thereby reduce tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Patients with lower LDHB expression are more likely to be beneficial responders.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to investigate racial and socioeconomic disparities for patients with pancreatic cancer across different facility types. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The National Cancer Database was queried for pancreatic cancer cases from 2004 to 2015. Along with propensity score matching analysis, multivariate logistic and Cox model were used to assess effects of facility type, race, elements of socioeconomics on receipt of treatment, time to treatment, and overall survival, separately. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among 223,465 patients, 44.6%, 42.1%, and 13.3% were treated at academic, community, and integrated facilities, respectively. Private insurance was associated with more treatment (odds ratio, 1.41; P &lt; 0.001) and better survival [hazards ratio (HR), 0.84; P &lt; 0.001]. Higher education was associated with earlier treatment (HR, 1.09; P &lt; 0.001). African Americans had less treatment (odds ratio, 0.97; P = 0.04) and delayed treatment (HR, 0.89; P &lt; 0.001) despite later stage at diagnosis. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, African Americans had similar survival (HR, 0.99; P = 0.11) overall and improved survival (HR, 0.95; P = 0.016) at integrated facilities. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Higher socioeconomic status was associated with better treatment and survival. After adjusting for socioeconomic disparities, race did not affect survival. Less racial disparity was observed at integrated facilities.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The association of Lewis antigen phenotype with survival of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was investigated. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 1187 patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were evaluated in a prospective cohort. Patients were classified into 3 different groups according to Lewis antigen phenotype: Lewis antigen (1) A positive [Le(a+b-)], (2) B positive [Le(a-b+)], and (3) negative [Le(a-b-)]. Risk of mortality was analyzed with Cox regression after adjusting for other predictors. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The risk of mortality increased in the order of Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le(a-b-) [reference; hazard ratio (HR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.03-1.57; P = 0.02; and HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.31-2.09; P &lt; 0.001] after adjusting for other predictors. Among patients with serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 lower than 37 U/mL, the association seemed more apparent (reference; HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.77-2.29; P = 0.22; and HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.10-4.02; P &lt; 0.02). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The risk of mortality increased in the order of Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le(a-b-). The difference in prognosis according to the Lewis antigen phenotype was more pronounced in the low CA 19-9 group, which suggests that the Lewis antigen phenotype works as a biomarker predicting the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer with undetectable CA 19-9 level.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Ultrasound (US) elastography has been proposed for the non-invasive prediction of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) in patients undergoing pancreatic resection. We aimed to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of US elastography in predicting CR-POPF. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:MEDLINE via PubMed, Ovid Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases, and abstracts of international conference proceedings were searched up to April 20, 2020. Studies assessing the performance of abdominal US elastography in predicting CR-POPF in patients undergoing pancreatic resection were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Five studies, including 247 patients who underwent partial pancreatic resection of whom 72 patients experiencing CR-POPF, were selected. All studies performed US elastography in different pancreatic sites. The pooled mean strain value was lower in pancreatic segments of patients experiencing CR-POPF than in those without, with a pooled weighted mean difference of -0.187 (95% confidence intervals, -0.303 to -0.071; P = 0.002). There was low heterogeneity between studies (I = 7.6%), and all studies were at “high risk” or “unclear risk” of bias.

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic acinar necrosis is a typical feature in the early phase of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) has been reported to play important roles in promoting insulin secretion and tumor cell proliferation, but its effect on necrosis remains unknown. This study revealed the important role of CHRM3 in regulating L-arginine-induced SAP and the molecular mechanisms. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:To verify the function of CHRM3, pancreatic tissues and primary acinar cells of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Chrm3 knockout mice were used in CHRM3 knockdown experiments, and to ascertain the CHRM3 overexpression, PLV-EGFP-Chrm3 plasmids were transfected in acinar cells in vitro. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In L-arginine-induced SAP, CHRM3 is activated and regulates SAP through the mitogen-activated protein kinase/p38 pathway. Moreover, the expression of miR-31-5p decreased in the SAP model both in vitro and in vivo. Mir-31-5p effects the necrosis of acinar cells in SAP by upregulating the target gene RIP3, and miR-31-5p is a downstream miRNA of CHRM3. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Necrosis in L-arginine-induced SAP is promoted by CHRM3 through the mitogen-activated protein kinase-p38/miR-31-5p/RIP3 axis.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:In this article, the aims were to study the expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in patients with pancreatic cancer and to elucidate the relevance between HSF1, angiogenesis, clinicopathological factors, and prognosis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Pancreatic cancer, paracancerous, and normal pancreatic tissues were collected. The HSF1 RNA and protein expressions were identified using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Associations of HSF1 and cluster of differentiation 34 with clinical variables and disease outcomes were investigated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Compared with the normal pancreatic and paracancerous tissue, HSF1 RNA and protein significantly showed higher expression in the pancreatic cancer tissue and was significantly associated with microvessel density. The high expression of HSF1 did not correspond to the patients’ sex, age, carcinoembryonic antigen level, diameter of tumors, and locations; however, it corresponded significantly with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level, lymph node metastasis, tumor node metastasis stage, differentiation degree, vascular invasion, and distant metastasis. The expression levels of HSF1 and cluster of differentiation 34 were significantly correlated with prognosis, disease specificity, and survival. The high expression of HSF1 would lead to worse prognosis and decrease in survival time and disease-free survival time. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:HSF1 expression level in pancreatic cancer tissue could be an ideal prognostic biomarker for risk stratification and a potential therapeutic target for patients with pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The interferon-induced protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) seems to be associated with the prognosis in pancreatic cancer. Here we clarify whether the heterogeneity of IFIT3 expression affects previous IFIT3 analysis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This retrospective study analyzes pancreatic cancer tissue samples retrieved by surgery from 2 independent patient cohorts. Patients underwent either primary surgery (n = 72) or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 12). Immunohistochemistry assessed IFIT3 expression and its heterogeneity. Complementarily, we analyzed publicly available transcriptomic data (n = 903). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the primarily resected tumors, 16.4% were heterogeneous. Patients with IFIT3-negative tumors did not survive longer compared with patients with IFIT3-positive tumors. An analysis of publicly available data confirmed this result. Patients developing lung metastases had the best prognosis (4.8 years) with significantly lower IFIT3 expression compared with liver metastasis (P = 0.0117). Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy who are IFIT3 negative had a longer disease-free survival (1.2 vs 0.3 years, P = 0.0081). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Low IFIT3 expression is not associated with longer survival. Divergent results from tissue microarray analyses could be explained with tumor heterogeneity. As a single biomarker, IFIT3 is not suitable for predicting disease prognosis. Recurrence of lung metastases and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are associated with low IFIT3 expression.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The objective of this study was to investigate the pattern and the oncologic impact of local recurrence after surgical resection of pancreatic cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:From July 1992 to December 2016, 388 patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:At a median follow-up of 29.0 months, 286 (73.7%) of the 367 patients experienced recurrence, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 31.3%. The first recurrence pattern was local in 83 patients (22.0%), systemic in 152 patients (40.2%), and locosystemic in 51 patients (13.5%). There was no difference in overall survival between the patients who had either local or systemic recurrence (P &gt; 0.05). Remnant pancreas, common hepatic artery, celiac trunk, and para-aortic area were the common local recurrence sites in both head and body/tail cancer. However, the superior mesenteric artery (P = 0.050) and portal vein (P = 0.001) were more frequent local recurrence sites for a head tumor, and the surgical bed was a common recurrence site for body/tail tumor (P &lt; 0.001).

<p>Historically, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPDAC) was considered a palliative condition. Advances in treatment have resulted in studies reporting survival after neoadjuvant treatment and surgery similar to earlier disease stages. However, there is no consensus on optimal LAPDAC management. Our aim was a systematic review of published evidence on LAPDAC treatment strategies with curative intent. Twenty-eight studies defining LAPDAC as per established criteria and reporting outcomes after neoadjuvant treatment with a view to resection were included. Primary outcomes were resection rate and proportion of curative resections. Secondary outcomes were postoperative mortality, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Neoadjuvant treatment varied significantly, most common being the combination of folinic acid, fluorouracil, irontecan, and oxaliplatin. Median percentage of patients proceeding to surgery after completion of neoadjuvant pathway was 33.5%. Median resection rate was 25%. Median R0 resection was 80% of resected patients. These outcomes ranged 0% to 100% across studies. Ninety-day postoperative mortality ranged from 0% to 5%. Median progression-free and overall survival for resected patients were 12.9 and 30 months, respectively, versus 13.2 months overall survival for unresected patients. In conclusion, although there is wide variability in reported LAPDAC resection rates post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, retrospective data suggest that neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery results in improved survival.</p>

<p>Filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeletal remodeling is critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β-cells, and its dysregulation causes type 2 diabetes. The adaptor protein APPL1 promotes first-phase GSIS by up-regulating soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein expression. However, whether APPL2 (a close homology of APPL1 with the same domain organization) plays a role in β-cell functions is unknown. Here, we show that APPL2 enhances GSIS by promoting F-actin remodeling via the small GTPase Rac1 in pancreatic β-cells. β-cell specific abrogation of APPL2 impaired GSIS, leading to glucose intolerance in mice. APPL2 deficiency largely abolished glucose-induced first- and second-phase insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Real-time live-cell imaging and phalloidin staining revealed that APPL2 deficiency abolished glucose-induced F-actin depolymerization in pancreatic islets. Likewise, knockdown of APPL2 expression impaired glucose-stimulated F-actin depolymerization and subsequent insulin secretion in INS-1E cells, which were attributable to the impairment of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation. Treatment with the F-actin depolymerization chemical compounds or overexpression of gelsolin (a F-actin remodeling protein) rescued APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS. In addition, APPL2 interacted with Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RacGAP1) in a glucose-dependent manner via the bin/amphiphysin/rvs-pleckstrin homology (BAR-PH) domain of APPL2 in INS-1E cells and HEK293 cells. Concomitant knockdown of RacGAP1 expression reverted APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS, F-actin remodeling, and Rac1 activation in INS-1E cells. Our data indicate that APPL2 interacts with RacGAP1 and suppresses its negative action on Rac1 activity and F-actin depolymerization thereby enhancing GSIS in pancreatic β-cells.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND AND AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Destroying visceral sensory nerves impacts pancreatic islet function, glucose metabolism and diabetes onset, but how islet endocrine cells interact with sensory neurons has not been studied. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We characterized the anatomical pattern of pancreatic sensory innervation by combining viral tracing, immunohistochemistry, and reporter mouse models. To assess the functional interactions of beta cells with vagal sensory neurons, we recorded Ca2+ responses in individual nodose neurons in vivo while selectively stimulating beta cells with chemogenetic and pharmacologic approaches. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found that pancreatic islets are innervated by vagal sensory axons expressing Phox2b, substance P, calcitonin-gene related peptide, and the serotonin receptor 5HT3R. Centrally, vagal neurons projecting to the pancreas terminate in the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract. Nodose neurons responded in vivo to chemogenetic stimulation of beta cells and to pancreas infusion with serotonin, but were not sensitive to insulin. Responses to chemogenetic and pharmacological stimulation of beta cells were blocked by a 5HT3R antagonist and were enhanced by increasing serotonin levels in beta cells. We further confirmed directly in living pancreas slices that sensory terminals in the islet were sensitive to serotonin. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our study establishes that pancreatic beta cells communicate with vagal sensory neurons, likely using serotonin signaling as a transduction mechanism. Serotonin is co-released with insulin and may therefore convey information about the secretory state of beta cells via vagal afferent nerves.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Postoperative pancreatic fistula/POPF is the most feared complication in pancreatic surgery. Although several systematic reviews investigated the impact of somatostatin analogues on POPF, no stratification was performed regarding type of pancreatic resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy/PD; distal pancreatectomy/DP) and different somatostatin analogues. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This study was planed according to the Preferred-Reporting-Items-for-Systematic -Review-and-Meta-Analysis/PRISMA-guidelines. After screening databases for randomized controlled trials/RCT, studies were stratified into pancreatic resection techniques and data were pooled in meta-analyses containing subgroups of octreotide, somatostatin, lanreotide, pasireotide and vapreotide. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The meta-analysis of studies with a mixed cohort of patients after pancreatic resection revealed a protective effect of somatostatin analogues for morbidity (RR: 0.71, p &lt; .00001) but not for mortality (RR: 1.07, = 0.78) or intra-abdominal abscesses (RR: 1.00, p = 1.00). Moreover, no effect was visible for mortality (RR: 1.57, p = .15), morbidity (RR: 0.87, p = .15) and intra-abdominal abscesses (RR: 0.92, p = .48) after PD. The meta-analysis of patients after PD revealed no impact of somatostatin analogues on POPF (RR: 0.87, p = .19) and clinically relevant POPF (RR: 0.69, p = .30). However, treatment with somatostatin analogues in the mixed cohort showed less POPF (RR: 0.60, p &lt; .00001) and clinically relevant POPF (RR: 0.47, p = .02), which was also the case after DP (RR: 0.41, p = .03). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Somatostatin analogues did not affect POPF and clinically relevant POPF after PD, but seemed to be associated with less POPF after DP. As no sufficiently powered RCT could be identified by the systematic review, further RCTs are urgently needed to investigate the effect of somatostatin analogues after DP.

<p>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is more prevalent in older patients, but early-onset cases (&lt;55 years) may be a distinct genetic subpopulation. Differential expression of CDKN2A and transcription factor FOXC2 were found in early-onset cases. This finding opens the door to investigating additional features that distinguish PDAC tumors in this age group.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:-To assess the efficacy of a pilot Chronic Pancreatitis (CP) Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinic. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:- 60 patients referred to a pilot MDT CP clinic were analysed. Anthropometric data, nutrition status, malabsorption evidence, glycaemic control, opiate use, bone mineral density (BMD) assessment and quality of life (QoL) were examined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:-The average age was 51.27 (±12.75). The commonest aetiology was alcohol (55%). Ninety one point five percent had evidence of ongoing pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, with 88.1% requiring initiation or up-titration of pancreatic enzyme replacement (PERT). Up to half of the patients exhibited micronutrient deficiency. Twenty eight percent were diagnosed with type IIIc diabetes. There was an average daily reduction of 6 mg of morphine usage per patient with a concurrent decline in median pain scores from 83.3 to 63.3, which was non-significant. The median QoL score was 33.3 compared to a score of 75 from the reference population. QoL scores increased from 31.0 to 37.3 at follow up appointments. Seventy two point five percent of patients had undiagnosed low BMD. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The data suggest that CP patients have significant nutritional deficiencies as well as undiagnosed diabetes, poor pain and glycaemic control which negatively impacts QoL. Assessment in a multi-disciplinary clinic ensures appropriate management.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:To the authors’ knowledge, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cytopathology practices worldwide has not been investigated formally. In the current study, data from 41 respondents from 23 countries were reported. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Data regarding the activity of each cytopathology laboratory during 4 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown were collected and compared with those obtained during the corresponding period in 2019. The overall number and percentage of exfoliative and fine-needle aspiration cytology samples from each anatomic site were recorded. Differences in the malignancy and suspicious rates between the 2 periods were analyzed using a meta-analytical approach. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, the sample volume was lower compared with 2019 (104,319 samples vs 190,225 samples), with an average volume reduction of 45.3% (range, 0.1%-98.0%). The percentage of samples from the cervicovaginal tract, thyroid, and anorectal region was significantly reduced (P &lt; .05). Conversely, the percentage of samples from the urinary tract, serous cavities, breast, lymph nodes, respiratory tract, salivary glands, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and biliary tract increased (P &lt; .05). An overall increase of 5.56% (95% CI, 3.77%-7.35%) in the malignancy rate in nongynecological samples during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed. When the suspicious category was included, the overall increase was 6.95% (95% CI, 4.63%-9.27%). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a drastic reduction in the total number of cytology specimens regardless of anatomic site or specimen type. The rate of malignancy increased, reflecting the prioritization of patients with cancer who were considered to be at high risk. Prospective monitoring of the effect of delays in access to health services during the lockdown period is warranted.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Imaging-based surveillance programs fail to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at a curable stage, creating an urgent need for diagnostic biomarkers. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice (PJ) was collected from the duodenal lumen during endoscopic ultrasound. The yield of biomarkers and organoids was compared for 2 collection techniques (endoscope suction channel vs catheter-based) and 3 periods (0-4 vs 4-8 vs 8-15 minutes). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Collection through the endoscope suction channel was superior to collection with a catheter. Collection beyond 8 minutes reduced biomarker yield. PJ-derived organoid culture was feasible. Label=“DISCUSSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The optimal protocol for secretin-stimulated PJ collection is through the endoscope suction channel for 8 minutes allowing biomarker detection and organoid culture.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Besides host defense against infections, the main function of the immune system is to eliminate tumor cells. Therefore, nearly, all solid tumors have a heterogeneous fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, which consists of myofibroblastic cells, extracellular matrix components, and infiltrates from various types of immune cell. In particular, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a prototype of a tumor with a pronounced inflammatory microenvironment, in which the majority of the tumor mass consists of nonneoplastic stromal and immune cells. Our own data and data from the literature indicate a protective role of tumor-infiltrating T cells for the host. On the other hand, we were able to show that a defined T cell subpopulation paradoxically promotes the progression of the tumor. Our investigations now focus on these cells, known as “Th17,” in the tumor microenvironment. Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To elucidate the mechanisms of the infiltrated immune cells and their mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Human pancreatic cancer tissue was used for (immune) histological staining and morphometric analysis and the results were correlated with clinical parameters and with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging images. The molecular mechanisms were analyzed in cell culture approaches using human tumor cells and human immune cells. With molecular biological methods and functional assays cell growth, invasion and colony formation were assessed. The in vivo correlation of the results and functional interventions were tested in murine and avian (xenograft) models. Label=“RESULTS AND CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Tumor-infiltrating immune cells of type Th17 and their mediators promoted the progression of the tumor depending on density, activation status, and cytokine profile. On molecular level, we identified a Th17-mediated increase of tumor cell migration and invasion, an increased neoangiogenesis, as well as a reorganization of the tumor stroma and microarchitecture. The data show that the progression of pancreatic cancer, depends on the status of activation and the cytokine profile of the infiltrated T cells.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Nowadays, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), and fine needle biopsy (FNB) are considered the best procedures for the diagnosis of biliopancreatic lesions. These methods represent a milestone since they proved to be both safe for the patient and useful to achieve diagnostic material useful to plan the best treatment strategy. Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Since in the literature, a debate between cytology and histology supporters is still ongoing and the trend is changing in favor of FNB, we would like to present our experience about the diagnostic yield of FNA and FNB. The aim of our study is to highlight FNA versus FNB diagnostic role of biliopancreatic lesions, highlight advantages, and drawbacks of these procedures, and our view on these 2 procedures and whether they should still be considered complementary or opposing techniques. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively reviewed our hospital series of 469 EUS diagnostics procedures of biliopancreatic lesions performed in 419 patients, between 2015 and 2019. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The overall adequacy rates of FNA and FNB were, respectively, 98.9 and 100%. Stratifying cases according to anatomic location of the mass (pancreas vs. biliary system), we detected 168 malignancies out of 349 pancreatic lesions (168/349; 48.1%), while biliary system cases positive for malignancy represented 33.8% (23/68 cases) (p value = 0.045, χ2 test). As for concomitant FNB, our series displayed a high rate of diagnostic concordance (88.8%). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Despite numerous data published, it is still unclear which is the most feasible method to use; therefore, we compared FNA, FNB, or their combination to understand the best applicable technique. Our experience confirmed that FNA is extremely efficient in the diagnosis of biliopancreatic lesions, especially in the hands of expert endoscopists and pathologists. Considering anatomic location, EUS-FNA is more accurate for mass-forming neoplasms in the pancreatic parenchyma rather than for lesions of the biliary system. Moreover, concomitant FNB usually confirmed the cytological diagnosis, allowing a deeper immunohistochemical characterization of the neoplasia. This proves that a “pure” cytology and “pure” histology approach should be looked differently since these are complementary techniques especially if we can obtain a cellblock from FNA.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:In the absence of rapid on-side pathological evaluation, endoscopy staff generally “smears” endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) specimens on a glass slide. As this technique is vulnerable to preparation artifacts, we assessed if its quality could be improved through a smear-preparation-training for endoscopy staff. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In this prospective pilot study, 10 endosonographers and 12 endoscopy nurses from seven regional EUS-centers in the Netherlands were invited to participate in a EUS-FNA smear-preparation-training. Subsequently, post training slides derived from solid pancreatic lesions were compared to pre-training “control” slides. Primary outcome was to assess if the training positively affects smear quality and, consequently, diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Participants collected and prepared 71 cases, mostly pancreatic head lesions (48%). Sixty-eight controls were selected from the pretraining period. The presence of artifacts was comparable for smears performed before and after training (76% vs 82%, P = .36). Likewise, smear cellularity (≥50% target cells) before and after training did not differ (44% (30/68) vs 49% (35/71), P = .48). Similar, no difference in diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was detected (P = .10). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In this pilot EUS-FNA smear-preparation-training for endoscopy personnel, smear quality and diagnostic accuracy were not improved after the training. Based on these results, we plan to further study other training programs and possibilities.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging cancers to treat. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and lack of curative treatment modalities, the 5-y survival rate of PDAC patients is one of the lowest of any cancer type. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted. Therefore, identification of effective drug combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify gene targets whose inhibition creates synergistic tumor growth inhibition with gemcitabine (Gem), a first- or second-line chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as an effective druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition indicate that loss of PRMT5 activity synergistically enhances Gem cytotoxicity due to the accumulation of excessive DNA damage. At the molecular level, we show that inhibition of PRMT5 results in RPA depletion and impaired homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) activity. The combination (Gem + PRMT5 inhibition) creates conditional lethality and synergistic reduction of PDAC tumors in vivo. The findings demonstrate that unbiased genetic screenings combined with a clinically relevant model system is a practical approach in identifying synthetic lethal drug combinations for cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Label=“AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal malignancies. Hence, there is a need for new markers and treatment strategies. P68/DEAD box protein 5 (DDX5) is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the DEAD box protein family. It is a prognostic marker for several cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression and clinical relevance of DDX5 in PDAC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:DDX5 expression in tissue microarray blocks containing 230 PDAC samples was examined using immunohistochemical analysis. DDX5 expression was considered high when more than 50% of the cells were stained and low when less than 50% of the cells were stained. We investigated the association between DDX5 expression and clinicopathological parameters, including patient survival. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The nuclei of normal pancreatic ducts, normal acinar cells and PDAC cells were stained positive for DDX5 although the intensity and distribution of DDX5 expression varied. Islet cells showed strong and diffuse staining of DDX5. DDX5 expression was low and high in 148 (64.3%) and 82 cases (35.7%), respectively. Low DDX5 expression was significantly associated with an advanced pT factor (pT2-pT3: tumour size,&gt;20 mm), lymphatic involvement, advanced tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (stages IIB, III, and IV), and venous involvement. In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that DDX5 expression is an independent prognostic factor for PDAC. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:These results suggest that DDX5 plays an important role in tumour invasiveness and PDAC prognosis.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The identification of genetic risk factors for chronic pancreatitis, such as PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1, provides the opportunity to define key pathologic hallmarks and etiologic-specific changes. For example, pancreata from PRSS1 and CFTR patients exhibit progressive lipomatous atrophy without significant fibrosis. Considering the pathology of SPINK1-associated pancreatitis is ill-defined, we examined the pancreata of SPINK1 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Histologic sections after total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation and associated clinicopathologic data were collected from 28 patients with SPINK1 germline alterations. Clinical findings, germline data, anatomic anomalies and pathologic findings were descriptively evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Patients ranged in age from 5 to 48 years (median, 21.6 years) with abdominal pain between 2 and 25 years (median, 5.8 years). Most patients were SPINK1 heterozygous and 14 (50%) had co-occurring CFTR (n = 12) and CTRC (n = 2) mutations. Other pancreatitis risk factors included anatomic anomalies (n = 9) and tobacco use (n = 1). Overall, 24 (86%) patients had additional pancreatitis-associated germline alterations, SPINK1 homozygosity, anatomic anomalies or environmental factors. Examination of pancreata revealed a sequential pattern of exocrine parenchymal loss and replacement by prominent fibrosis, dependent on the duration of abdominal pain. No malignancies were identified, but low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia was present for 2 cases. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Within this descriptive study, SPINK1-associated pancreatitis is characterized by parenchymal fibrosis and suggests divergent pathophysiologic mechanisms from PRSS1 and CFTR-associated pancreatitis. Moreover, SPINK1 patients frequently had additional etiologic factors that did not impact the development of pancreatic fibrosis and may implicate SPINK1 as a disease modifier gene.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Acute pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disorder of high incidence resulting in life threatening complications in up to 20% of patients. Its severe form is characterized by an extensive and systemic immune response. We investigated the role of the adaptive immune response in two experimental models of pancreatitis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In C57BI/6-mice mild pancreatitis was induced by 8-hourly injections of caerulein and severe pancreatitis by additional, partial pancreatic duct ligation. T-cell-activation was determined by flow-cytometry of CD25/CD69, T-cell-differentiation by nuclear staining of the transcription-factors Tbet, Gata3 and Foxp3. In vivo CD4+ T-cells were depleted using anti-CD4 antibody. Disease severity was determined by histology, serum amylase and lipase activities, lung MPO and serum cytokine levels (IL-6, TNFα, IL-10). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In both models T-cells were activated. Th1-differentiation (Tbet) was absent during pancreatitis but we detected a pronounced Th2/Treg (Gata3/Foxp3) response which paralleled disease severity in both models. The complete depletion of CD4+ T-cells via anti-CD4 antibody, surprisingly, reduced disease severity significantly, as well as granulocyte infiltration and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Co-incubation of acini and T-cells did not lead to T-cell-activation by acinar cells but to acinar damage by T-cells. During pancreatitis no significant T-cell-infiltration into the pancreas was observed. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:T cells orchestrate the early local as well as the systemic immune responses in pancreatitis and are directly involved in organ damage. The Th2 response appears to increase disease severity, rather than conferring an immunological protection.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:For most patients, pancreatic adenocarcinoma responds poorly to treatment, and novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Standard-of-care paclitaxel (PTX), combined with birinapant (BRP), a bivalent mimetic of the apoptosis antagonist SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases), exerts synergistic killing of PANC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:To investigate potential mechanisms underlying this synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction, data capturing PANC-1 cell growth, apoptosis kinetics, and cell cycle distribution were integrated with high-quality IonStar-generated proteomic data capturing changes in the relative abundance of more than 3300 proteins as the cells responded to the two drugs, alone and combined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:PTX alone (15 nM) elicited dose-dependent G2/M-phase arrest and cellular polyploidy. Combined BRP/PTX (150/15 nM) reduced G2/M by 35% and polyploid cells by 45%, and increased apoptosis by 20%. Whereas BRP or PTX alone produced no change in the pro-apoptotic protein pJNK, and a slight increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, the drug combination increased pJNK and decreased Bcl2 significantly compared to the vehicle control. A multi-scale, mechanism-based mathematical model was developed to investigate integrated birinapant/paclitaxel effects on temporal profiles of key proteins involved in kinetics of cell growth, death, and cell cycle distribution. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The model, consistent with the observed reduction in the Bcl2/BAX ratio, suggests that BRP-induced apoptosis of mitotically-arrested cells is a major contributor to the synergy between BRP and PTX. Coupling proteomic and cellular response profiles with multi-scale pharmacodynamic modeling provides a quantitative mechanistic framework for evaluating pharmacodynamically-based drug-drug interactions in combination chemotherapy, and could potentially guide the development of promising drug regimens.</p>

<p>Label=“Objectives” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Biological behavior of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan NETs) is difficult to predict on morphology alone. The assessment of proliferation by the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) is considered to be an important prognostic parameter in these tumors and has been endorsed by the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for Pan NETs. Although widely accepted on surgical specimens, there is varied opinion on grading of these tumors on cytology samples. This study aimed at classification and grading of Pan NETs on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) using the recent 2017 WHO criteria and assess the reliability of Ki-67 grading by comparing it with histology samples wherever available. Label=“Material and Methods” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Search of cytopathology lab records over a 3-year period (June 2015-May 2018) revealed 33 cases of pancreatic NETs diagnosed on EUS-FNA specimens. Using the guidelines of 2017 WHO classification and grading of Pan NETs, retrospective grading of these Pan NETs was done. They were graded as Grades 1, 2, and 3 well differentiated Pan NETs and poorly differentiated Grade 3 neoplasms based on Ki-67 PI and cytomorphology. Cytomorphological features were compared across the three grades. The cytological grading was then compared with the histological grading where available. Label=“Results” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Ki-67 grading on cytology was done in 32 cases (22 on cell block and 10 on smears), of which 19 (59.4%) were Grade 1, 8 (25%) were Grade 2, and 5 (15.6%) were Grade 3 tumors. The most common cytomorphological features observed in Grade 1 tumors were small round uniform cells with granular chromatin and prominent plasmacytoid morphology. As the grade increased, tumor cells showed increased pleomorphism, angulated nuclei, and less frequent plasmacytoid cells. Histopathology (biopsy/resected specimens) was available in 11 of the 32 cases. Comparison of grading on cytology and histology showed concordance in ten of the 11 cases (k value = 0.862). Label=“Conclusion” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Our data suggest that grading of Pan NETs by assessing Ki-67 PI on cytology samples collected by EUS-FNA shows good agreement with that measured on histology samples.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:A subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) is highly resistant to systemic chemotherapy, but no markers are available in clinical settings to identify this subset. We hypothesized that a glycan biomarker for PDACs called sialylated tumor-related antigen (sTRA) could be used for this purpose. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We tested for differences between PDACs classified by glycan expression in multiple systems: sets of cell lines, organoids, and isogenic cell lines; primary tumors; and blood plasma from human subjects. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The sTRA-expressing models tended to have stem-like gene expression and the capacity for mesenchymal differentiation, in contrast to the nonexpressing models. The sTRA cell lines also had significantly increased resistance to seven different chemotherapeutics commonly used against pancreatic cancer. Patients with primary tumors that were positive for a gene expression classifier for sTRA received no statistically significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, in contrast to those negative for the signature. In another cohort, based on direct measurements of sTRA in tissue microarrays, the patients who were high in sTRA again had no statistically significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, a blood plasma test for the sTRA glycan identified the PDACs that showed rapid relapse following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This research demonstrates that a glycan biomarker could have value to detect chemotherapy-resistant PDAC in clinical settings. This capability could aid in the development of stratified treatment plans and facilitate biomarker-guided trials targeting resistant PDAC.</p>

<p>Pancreatic fistula has been the defining complication and challenge of pancreatic surgery. Better awareness and mitigation of postoperative pancreatic fistulas has led to significant improvements in morbidity and mortality of pancreatic surgery. The definition and management of pancreatic fistulas has sequentially progressed over the last three decades; the literature ranges from retrospective, observational studies to prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials. The landmark literature contributions driving the perioperative management of pancreatic fistulas are detailed in this article.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest cancer. Cancer-associated thrombosis/thromboembolism (CAT), frequently observed in PDAC, is known as a poor prognostic factor. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms between PDAC and CAT, and performed a trial of therapeutic approach for PDAC using a genetically engineered mouse model, PKF (Ptf1acre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tgfbr2flox/flox ). Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Presence of CAT in PKF mice was detected by systemic autopsy. Plasma cytokines were screened by cytokine antibody array. Murine and human plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) were determined by ELISA. Distribution of VCAM-1 in PKF mice and human autopsy samples was detected by immunohistochemistry. PKF mice were treated with anti-VCAM-1 antibody and the effects on survival, distribution of CAT and the tumour histology were analysed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found spontaneous CAT with cardiomegaly in 68.4% PKF mice. Increase of plasma ANP and sVCAM-1 was observed in PKF mice and PDAC patients with CAT. VCAM-1 was detected in the activated endothelium and thrombi. Administration of anti-VCAM-1 antibody to PKF mice inhibited tumour growth, neutrophil/macrophage infiltration, tumour angiogenesis and progression of CAT; moreover, it dramatically extended survival (from 61 to 253 days, p&lt;0.01). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Blocking VCAM-1/sVCAM-1 might be a potent therapeutic approach for PDAC as well as CAT, which can contribute to the prognosis. Increase of plasma ANP and sVCAM-1 might be a diagnostic approach for CAT in PDAC.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Conjugated bile acids are metabolised by upper small intestinal microbiota, and serum levels of taurine-conjugated bile acids are elevated and correlated with insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes. However, whether changes in taurine-conjugated bile acids are necessary for small intestinal microbiome to alter insulin action remain unknown. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We evaluated circulating and specifically brain insulin action using the pancreatic-euglycaemic clamps in high-fat (HF) versus chow fed rats with or without upper small intestinal healthy microbiome transplant. Chemical and molecular gain/loss-of-function experiments targeting specific taurine-conjugated bile acid-induced changes of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the brain were performed in parallel. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found that short-term HF feeding increased the levels of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA, an FXR ligand) in the upper small intestine, ileum, plasma and dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the brain. Transplantation of upper small intestinal healthy microbiome into the upper small intestine of HF rats not only reversed the rise of TCDCA in all reported tissues but also enhanced the ability of either circulating hyperinsulinaemia or DVC insulin action to lower glucose production. Further, DVC infusion of TCDCA or FXR agonist negated the enhancement of insulin action, while genetic knockdown or chemical inhibition of FXR in the DVC of HF rats reversed insulin resistance. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our findings indicate that FXR in the DVC is sufficient and necessary for upper small intestinal microbiome-mediated changes of TCDCA to alter insulin action in rats, and highlight a previously unappreciated TCDCA-FXR axis linking gut microbiome and host insulin action.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Concurrent gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment is one of the preferred chemotherapy regimens for metastatic and locally-advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Previous studies demonstrate that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is critical for nab-paclitaxel uptake into tumors and correlates with response. Gemcitabine increases nab-paclitaxel uptake by increasing Cav-1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with gemcitabine would further enhance the sensitivity of PDAC to nab-paclitaxel by increasing Cav-1 expression and nab-paclitaxel uptake. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We investigated the sensitivity of different gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment regimens in a panel of PDAC cell lines and orthotopic xenograft models. The sensitivity of different treatment regimens was compared to the standard concurrent treatment. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Pre-treatment with gemcitabine before nab-paclitaxel increased Cav-1 and albumin uptake and significantly decreased proliferation and clonogenicity compared to concurrent treatment, which correlated with increased levels of apoptosis. Cav-1 silencing reduced the uptake of albumin and therapeutic advantage observed when cells were pre-treated with gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel. Additionally, we observed that pre-treatment with gemcitabine resulted in partial synchronization of cells in the G2/M phase at the time of nab-paclitaxel treatment, providing another mechanism for the benefit of altered scheduling. In heterotopic and orthotopic xenograft models, the altered schedule of gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel significantly delayed tumor growth compared to concurrent delivery without added toxicity. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pre-treatment with gemcitabine significantly increased nab-paclitaxel uptake and correlated with an increased treatment efficacy and survival benefit in preclinical models, compared to standard concurrent treatment. These results justify preclinical and clinical testing of this altered scheduling combination.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Early gastric carcinoma is heterogeneous and can be divided into early gastric cardiac carcinoma (EGCC) and early gastric non-cardiac carcinoma (EGNCC) groups. At present, differences in clinicopathology remains obscure between EGCC and EGNCC fundus-corpus and antrum-angularis-pylorus subgroups, especially between EGCC with and without oesophageal invasion. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In this study, we studied 329 consecutive early gastric carcinoma radical gastrectomies with 70 EGCCs and 259 EGNCCs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Compared to the EGNCC antrum-angularis-pylorus (n = 181), but not fundus-corpus (n = 78), sub-group, EGCC showed significantly older age, lower prevalence of the grossly depressed pattern, better tumor differentiation, higher percentage of tubular/papillary adenocarcinoma, but lower frequency of mixed poorly cohesive carcinoma with tubular/papillary adenocarcinoma, and absence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in tumors with invasion up to superficial submucosa (SM1). In contrast, pure poorly cohesive carcinoma was less frequently seen in EGCCs than in EGNCCs, but mixed poorly cohesive carcinoma with tubular/papillary adenocarcinomas was significantly more common in the EGNCC antrum-angularis-pylorus sub-group than in any other group. No significant differences were found between EGCC and EGNCC sub-groups in gender, tumor size, H. pylori infection rate, and lymphovascular/perineural invasion. EGCC with oesophageal invasion (n = 22), compared to EGCC without (n = 48), showed no significant differences in the H. pylori infection rate and oesophageal columnar, intestinal, or pancreatic metaplasia, except for a higher percentage of the former in size &gt; 2 cm and tubular differentiation. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:There exist distinct clinicopathologic differences between EGCC and EGNCC sub-groups; EGCC was indeed of gastric origin. Further investigations with larger samples are needed to validate these findings.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To describe PNI and to evaluate its impact on disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although PNI is a prognostic factor for survival in many GI cancers, there is limited knowledge regarding its impact on tumor recurrence, especially in “early stage disease” (PDAC ≤20 mm, R0/N0 PDAC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This multicenter retrospective study included patients undergoing PDAC resection between 2009 and 2014. The association of PNI with DFS and OS was analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:PNI was found in 87% of 778 patients included in the study, with lower rates in PDAC ≤20 mm (78.7%) and in R0/N0 tumors (70.6%). PNI rate did not differ between patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and upfront surgery (88% vs 84%, P = 0.08). Although not significant at multivariate analysis (P = 0.07), patients with PNI had worse DFS at univariate analysis (median DFS: 20 vs 15 months, P &lt; 0.01). PNI was the only independent predictor of DFS in R0/N0 tumors (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.2) and in PDAC ≤20 mm (HR: 1.8). PNI was an independent predictor of OS in the entire cohort (27 vs 50 months, P = 0.01), together with G3 tumors, pN1 status, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9 &gt;37 and pain. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PNI represents a major determinant of tumor recurrence and patients’ survival in pancreatic cancer. The role of PNI is particularly relevant in early stages, supporting the hypothesis that invasion of nerves by cancer cells has a driving role in pancreatic cancer progression.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Biliary stricture in necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) has not been systematically categorized; therefore, we sought to define the incidence and natural history of biliary stricture caused by NP. Label=“SUMMARY/BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Benign biliary stricture occurs secondary to bile duct injury, anastomotic narrowing, or chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The profound loco-regional inflammatory response of NP creates challenging biliary strictures. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:NP patients treated between 2005-2019 were reviewed. Biliary stricture was identified on cholangiography as narrowing of the extrahepatic biliary tree to &lt; 75% of the diameter of the unaffected duct. Biliary stricture risk factors and outcomes were evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among 743 NP patients, 64 died, 13 were lost to follow up; therefore, a total of 666 patients were included in the final cohort. Biliary stricture developed in 108 (16%) patients. Mean follow up was 3.5 ± 3.3 years. Median time from NP onset to biliary stricture diagnosis was 4.2 months (IQR, 1.8-10.9). Presentation was commonly clinical or biochemical jaundice, n = 30 (28%) each. Risk factors for stricture development were splanchnic vein thrombosis and pancreatic head parenchymal necrosis. Median time to stricture resolution was 6.0 months after onset (2.8-9.8). A mean of 3.3 ± 2.3 procedures were performed. Surgical intervention was required in 22 (20%) patients. Endoscopic treatment failed in 17% (17/99) of patients and was not associated with stricture length. Operative treatment of biliary stricture was more likely in patients with infected necrosis or NP disease duration ≥6 months. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Biliary stricture occurs frequently after necrotizing pancreatitis and is associated with splanchnic vein thrombosis and pancreatic head necrosis. Surgical correction was performed in 20%.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The objective of this study was to characterize the patterns of first recurrence after curative-intent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:We evaluated the first site of recurrence after neoadjuvant treatment as locoregional (LR) or distant metastasis (DM). To validate our findings, we evaluated the pattern from two phase II clinical trials evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in PDAC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We identified site of first recurrence from a retrospective cohort of patients from 2011-2017 treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and then an operation or an operation first followed by adjuvant therapy, as well as two separate prospective cohorts of patients derived from two phase II clinical trials evaluating patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in borderline-resectable and locally advanced PDAC RESULTS:: In the retrospective cohorts, 160 out of 285 patients (56.1%) recurred after a median disease-free survival (mDFS) of 17.2 months. The pattern of recurrence was DM in 81.9% of patients, versus LR in 11.1%. This pattern was consistent in patients treated with upfront resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (DM 83.0%, LR 16.9%) regardless of margin-involvement (DM 80.1%, LR 19.4%). The use of NAC did not alter pattern of recurrence; 81.7% had DM and 18.3% had LR. This pattern also remained consistent regardless of margin-involvement (DM 94.1%, LR 5.9%). In the Phase II borderline-resectable trial (NCI# 01591733) cohort of 32 patients, the mDFS was 34.2 months. Pattern of recurrence remained predominantly DM (88.9%) versus LR (11.1%). In the Phase II locally-advanced trial (NCI# 01821729) cohort of 34 patients, the mDFS was 30.7 months. Although there was a higher rate of local recurrence in this cohort, pattern of first recurrence remained predominantly DM (66.6%) versus LR (33.3%) and remained consistent independent of margin-status. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The pattern of recurrence in PDAC is predominantly DM rather than LR, and is consistent regardless of the use of NAC and margin involvement.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Modified Appleby procedure could be indicated in stage III locally advanced body pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) involving the celiac axis after neoadjuvant treatment. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We report the case of a 38-year-old woman presenting a tumor arising from the body of the pancreas, involving the celiac trunk with the common hepatic artery and having contact with the anterior surface of the superior mesenteric artery. A fine-needle aspirate biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PADC. Eight cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy) were conducted. After 6 months, the CA19-9 levels were normalized, and the tumor remained stable without local growth or distant metastasis. To reduce the risk of ischemia-related complications and develop the pancreaticoduodenal arcades, a preoperative embolization of the common hepatic artery was performed. Then, surgical resection was considered 4 weeks after embolization. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The patient underwent a modified Appleby procedure including distal splenopancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection combined with lateral portal vein resection. Venous reconstruction was carried out using peritoneal patch.1 Pathologic evaluation revealed a 2.5-cm PDAC with negative resection margins. Postoperative course was marked by acute ischemic cholecystitis requiring reoperation at postoperative day 3. The treatment was completed with four cycles of FOLFIRINOX, and she was free of disease 6 months after surgery. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Nowadays, modified Appleby procedure is more frequently performed due to improvements in responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy which have led to better local control and more aggressive approaches in highly selected patients.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To evaluate somatic mutations, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the PDAC patients with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and find their associations with outcome. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Thirty-six PDAC patients with pCR were identified from 2009 to 2017. Macro-dissection was performed on resected specimens to isolate DNA from 332 regions of interest including fibrosis, normal duct, normal parenchyma, and undefined ductal cells (UDCs). Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and CTCs were also extracted. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to detect mutations of KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, TP53, GNAS, and BRAF Results: KRAS mutation was detected in UDCs and fibrosis while SMAD4, TP53 and GNAS were only seen in UDCs. Patients with TP53 mutation showed relatively worse overall survival (OS) (HR=3.596, 95%=0.855-15.130, P=0.081). Five patients available for CTCs data were all positive for CTCs and seven of 16 pCR patients were detected with ctDNA at surgery. We proposed a new concept of regression assessment combining genomic analysis of resected specimens and liquid biopsy data for PDAC, namely molecular complete response (mCR). Three of six mCR patients recurred as compared with six in fifteen non-mCR patients. Seven of 15 non-mCR patients died during follow-up while there was only one in six mCR patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study firstly reports that somatic mutations, CTCs and ctDNA existed even in PDAC patients with pCR to NAT, which could possibly predict early recurrence and reduced survival. The current regression evaluation system of PDAC needs to be re-assessed at a molecular level.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND AND AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Despite recent advances, patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers have a poor prognosis. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided acquisition of portal vein (PV) blood for enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The aim of this study was to assess PV-CTCs as potential biomarkers for the assessment of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:17 patients with biopsy-proven pancreaticobiliary malignancy were enrolled. CTCs were enumerated from both peripheral and PV blood. All patients were followed until death. PFS and OS were evaluated with the log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox-proportional hazards models were fitted to study the relationship between PV-CTCs and PFS and OS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:After 3.5 years of follow-up, all patients had expired. PV-CTCs were detected in all patients (median PV-CTCs 62.0/7.5 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 17-132). The mean PFS in patients with PV-CTCs &lt;185/7.5 mL was significantly longer than patients with PV-CTCs ≥185/7.5 mL (43.3 weeks vs. 12.8 weeks, log-rank p = 0.002). The mean OS in patients with PV-CTCs &lt;185/7.5 mL was significantly longer than patients with PV-CTCs ≥185/7.5 mL (75.8 weeks vs. 29.5 weeks, log-rank p = 0.021). In an adjusted Cox-proportional hazards model, PV-CTCs were significant predictors of both PFS and OS (HR 1.004, p = 0.037; HR 1.004, p = 0.044 respectively). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In this pilot and feasibility study, EUS-acquired PV-CTCs predicted PFS and OS. Our findings suggest that PV-CTCs can help provide important prognostic data for both providers and patients.</p>

<p>Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are an increasingly important public health problem. The majority of these lesions are benign but some progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is a dearth of mouse models of these conditions. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 regulates development, differentiation, and inflammation. Germline Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes mice to the oncogenic effects of mutant Kras in the pancreas. Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras (KPN+/- ), leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high-grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6, but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2, and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC. These results highlight that the effects of loss of one Nr5a2 allele are time- and cell context-dependent. KPN+/- mice represent a new model to study the formation of cystic pancreatic lesions and their relationship with PanINs and classical PDAC. Our findings suggest that pancreatitis could also contribute to acceleration of cystic tumour progression in patients. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:A novel technique of single-layer continuous suturing (SCS) for pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) during robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD), a technically straightforward procedure, has been shown to produce promising results in a previous study. The present RCT aims to show that SCS during RPD does not increase the incidence of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) when compared with modified Blumgart anastomosis (MBA). Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Between January 2019 and September 2019, consecutive patients (ASA score ≤ 2) who underwent RPD were enrolled and randomized to the SCS or the MBA group. The primary endpoint was the rate of CR-POPF. A noninferiority margin of 10% was chosen. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 186 patients, 4 were excluded because PJ was not performed. The remaining 182 patients were randomized to the SCS group (n = 89) or MBA group (n = 93). CR-POPF rate was not inferior in the SCS group [SCS: 6.7%, MBA: 11.8%; 95% confidence interval (- 0.76, - 0.06), P = 0.0002]. PJ duration was significantly lower in the SCS group (P &lt; 0.01). No significant differences were found between the two groups in operative time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, or rates of conversion to laparotomy, morbidity, reoperation, or mortality. On subgroup analysis of patients with a soft pancreas and small main pancreatic duct, SCS significantly reduced the duration of PJ. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study showed that SCS was not inferior to MBA in terms of the CR-POPF rate during RPD.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Consensus guidelines recommend surveillance of high-risk individuals (HRIs) for pancreatic cancer (PC) using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study aims to assess the yield of PC surveillance programs of HRIs and compare the detection of high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma by EUS and MRI. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The MEDLINE and Embase (Ovid) databases were searched for prospective studies published up to April 11, 2019 using EUS and/or MRI to screen HRIs for PC. Baseline detection of focal pancreatic abnormalities, cystic lesions, solid lesions, high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma, and all pancreatic adenocarcinoma were recorded. Weighted pooled proportions of outcomes detected were compared between EUS and MRI using random effects modeling. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 1097 studies were reviewed and 24 were included, representing 2112 HRIs who underwent imaging. The weighted pooled proportion of focal pancreatic abnormalities detected by baseline EUS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30-0.37) was significantly higher (p = 0.006) than by MRI (0.31, 95% CI 0.28-0.33). There were no significant differences between EUS and MRI in detection of other outcomes. The overall weighted pooled proportion of patients with high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma detected at baseline (regardless of imaging modality) was 0.0090 (95% CI 0.0022-0.016), corresponding to a number-needed-to-screen (NNS) of 111 patients to detect one high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Surveillance programs are successful in detecting high-risk precursor lesions. No differences between EUS and MRI were noted in the detection of high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma, supporting the use of either imaging modality.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIM” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), are produced by non-oxidative alcohol metabolism and can cause acinar cell damage and subsequent acute pancreatitis in rodent models. Even though experimental studies have elucidated the FAEE mediated early intra-acinar events, these mechanisms have not been well studied in humans. In the present study, we evaluate the early intra-acinar events and inflammatory response in human pancreatic acinar tissues and cells in an ex-vivo model. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Experiments were conducted using normal human pancreatic tissues exposed to FAEE. Subcellular fractionation was performed on tissue homogenates and trypsin and cathepsin B activities were estimated in these fractions. Acinar cell injury was evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Cytokine release from exposed acinar cells was evaluated by performing Immuno-fluorescence. Serum was collected from patients with AP within the first 72 h of symptom onset for cytokine estimation using FACS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We observed significant trypsin activation and acinar cell injury in FAEE treated tissue. Cathepsin B was redistributed from lysosomal to zymogen compartment at 30 min of FAEE exposure. IHC results indicated the presence of apoptosis in pancreatic tissue at 1 &amp; 2hrs of FAEE exposure. We also observed a time dependent increase in secretion of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α from FAEE treated acinar tissue. There was also a significant elevation in plasma cytokines in patents with alcohol associated AP within 72 h of symptom onset. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our data suggest that alcohol metabolites can cause acute acinar cell damage and subsequent cytokine release which could eventually culminant in SIRS.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The ISGPF postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) definition using amylase drain concentration is widely used. However, the interest of lipase drain concentration, daily drain output and absolute enzyme daily production (concentration x daily drain volume) have been poorly investigated. Label=“MATERIAL AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:These predictive on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, 5 and 7 were analyzed in a development cohort, and subsequently tested in an independent validation cohort. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 227 patients of the development cohort, 17% developed a biochemical fistula and 34% a POPF (Grade B/C). Strong correlation was found between amylase/lipase drain concentration at all postoperative days (ρ = 0.90; p = 0.001). Amylase and lipase were both significantly higher in patients with a POPF (p &lt; 0.001) presenting an equivalent under the ROC curve area (0.85 vs 0.84; p = 0.466). Combining POD1 and POD3 threefold enzyme cut-off value increased significantly POPF prediction sensibility (97.4% vs 77.8%) and NPV (97.1% vs 86.3%). These results were also confirmed in the validation cohort of 554 patients. Finally, absolute enzyme daily production and daily drain output were significantly higher in patients with a POPF (p &lt; 0.001) but did not add clinical value when compared to drain enzyme concentration. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Lipase is as effective as amylase drain concentration to define POPF. Absolute enzyme daily production or daily drain output do not help to better predict clinically significant POPF occurrence and severity. Lipase and amylase should mainly be used for their negative predictive value to predict the absence of clinically significant POPF and could allow early drain removal and hospital discharge.</p>

<p>Current management of infected pancreatic necrosis is focused on a minimally invasive step-up approach. The step-up approach consists of initial percutaneous or endoscopic drainage of infected pancreatic necrosis, followed, if necessary, by minimally invasive surgical or endoscopic debridement. While there is reduced morbidity and mortality, vascular complications can be life-threatening. Reported vascular complications have been limited to arterial bleeding. Venous bleeding has not been previously reported. We present two cases of portal venous bleeding in patients who underwent treatment for infected pancreatic necrosis with a step-up approach. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and initial management. Moreover, we present two different techniques that can be used to successfully manage venous bleeding in patients who have percutaneous drains in place as part of a step-up approach. These techniques involve tamponading the cavity or drain tract with topical hemostatics and direct embolization of the bleeding vein. These experiences can serve as a guide for managing portal venous bleeding in patients with infected pancreatic necrosis.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To define the association between hospital occupancy rate and postoperative outcomes among patients undergoing hepatopancreatic (HP) resection. Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Previous studies have sought to identify hospital-level characteristics associated with optimal surgical outcomes and decreased expenditures. The present study utilized a novel hospital quality metric coined “occupancy rate” based on publicly available data to assess differences in postoperative outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing HP procedures. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medicare beneficiaries who underwent an elective HP surgery between 2013 and 2017 were identified. Occupancy rate was calculated and hospitals were categorized into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the association between occupancy rate and clinical outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among 33,866 patients, the majority underwent a pancreatic resection (58.5%; n = 19,827), were male (88.4%; n = 7,488), or white (88.4%; n = 29,950); median age was 72 years [interquartile range (IQR): 68-77] and median Charleston Comorbidity Index was 3 (IQR 2-8). Hospitals were categorized into quartiles based on hospital occupancy rate (cutoffs: 48.1%, 59.4%, 68.2%). Most patients underwent an HP operation at a hospital with an above average occupancy rate (n = 20,865, 61.6%), whereas only a small subset of patients had an HP procedure at a low occupancy rate hospital (n = 1,218, 3.6%). On multivariable analysis, low hospital occupancy rate was associated with increased odds of a complication [(OR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.55) and 30-day mortality (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27-1.97). Even among only high-volume HP hospitals, patients operated on at hospitals that had a low occupancy rate were at markedly higher risk of complications (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.97), as well as 30 day morality (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27-3.83). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing an elective HP resection, more than 1 in 4 hospitals performing HP surgeries utilized less than half of their beds on average. There was a monotonic relationship between hospital occupancy rate and the odds of experiencing a complication, as well as 30-day mortality, independent of other hospital level characteristics including procedural volume.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The study objective is to determine the association between travel distance and surgical volume on outcomes after esophageal, pancreatic, and rectal cancer resections. Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:“Take the Volume Pledge” aims to centralize esophagectomies, pancreatectomies, and proctectomies to hospitals meeting minimum volume standards. The impact of travel, and possible care fragmentation, on potential benefits of centralized surgery is not well understood. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2016), patients who underwent esophageal, pancreatic, or rectal resections at far HVH meeting volume standards versus local intermediate (IVH) and low-volume (LVH) hospitals were identified. Perioperative outcomes and 5-year OS were compared. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 49,454 patients, 17,544 (34.5%) underwent surgery at far HVH, 11,739 (23.7%) at local IVH, and 20,171 (40.8%) at local LVH. The median (interquartile range) travel distances were 77.1 (51.1-125.4), 13.2 (5.8-27.3), and 7.8 (3.1-15.5) miles to HVH, IVH, and LVH, respectively. By multivariable analysis, LVH was associated with increased 30-day mortality for all resections compared to HVH, but IVH was associated with mortality only for proctectomies [odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.75]. Compared to HVH, both IVH (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.31) and LVH (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.29-1.42) were associated with decreased 5-year OS. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Compared to far HVH, 30-day mortality was higher for all resections at LVH, but only for proctectomies at IVH. Five-year OS was consistently worse at local LVH and IVH. Improving long-term outcomes at IVH may provide opportunities for greater access to quality cancer care.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal tumor response score (TRS) system to assess regression in pancreatic cancers resected after neoadjuvant therapy. We developed a novel TRS (Royal North Shore [RNS] system) based on estimating the percentage of tumor bed occupied by viable cancer and categorized into 3 tiers: grade 1 (≤10%), grade 2 (11% to 75%), and grade 3 (&gt;75%). We assessed 147 resected carcinomas with this and other TRS systems (College of American Pathologists [CAP], MD Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC], and Evans). The 3-tiered RNS system predicted median survival after surgery for grades 1, 2, and 3 of 54, 23, and 9 months, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The CAP, MDACC, and Evans systems also predicted survival (P&lt;0.05) but less consistently. The median survival for MDACC and CAP grade 0 (complete regression) was less than MDACC grade 1 and CAP grades 1 and 2. There was no difference in survival between CAP grades 2 and 3 (P=0.960), Evans grades 1 and 2a (P=0.395), and Evans grades 2a and 2b (P=0.587). Interobserver concordance was weak for CAP (κ=0.431), moderate for MDACC (κ=0.691), minimal for Evans (κ=0.307), and moderate to strong for RNS (κ=0.632 to 0.84). Of age, sex, size, stage, grade, perineural and vascular invasion, extrapancreatic extension, margin status, and RNS score, only RNS score, vascular invasion, and extrapancreatic extension predicted survival in univariate analysis. Only extrapancreatic extension (P=0.034) and RNS score (P&lt;0.0001) remained significant in multivariate analysis. We conclude that the RNS system is a reproducible and powerful predictor of survival after resection for pancreatic cancers treated with neoadjuvant therapy and should be investigated in larger cohorts.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:CRS/HIPEC is thought to confer a survival advantage for patients with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). However, the impact of nonperitoneal organ resection is not clearly defined. We evaluated the impact of major organ resection (MOR) on postoperative outcomes and overall survival (OS). Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The US HIPEC collaborative database (2000-2017) was reviewed for MPM patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC. MOR was defined as total or partial resection of diaphragm, stomach, spleen, pancreas, small bowel, colon, rectum, kidney, ureter, bladder, and/or uterus. MOR was categorized as 0, 1, or 2+ organs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 174 patients were identified. Median PCI was 16 (3-39). The distribution of patients with MOR-0, MOR-1, and MOR-2+ was 94, 45, and 35 patients, respectively. MOR-1 and MOR-2+ groups had a higher frequency of any complication compared with MOR-0 (57.8%, 74.3%, and 48.9%, respectively, p = 0.035), but Clavien 3/4 complications were similar. Median length of stay was slightly higher in the MOR-1 and MOR-2+ groups (10 and 11 days) compared with the MOR-0 cohort (9 days, p = 0.005). Incomplete cytoreduction, ASA class 4, and male gender were associated with increased mortality on unadjusted analysis; however, their impact on OS was attenuated on multivariable analysis. MOR was not associated with OS based on these data (MOR-1: HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.59-4.74; MOR-2+ : HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.22-2.69). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:MOR was not associated with an increase in major complications or worse OS in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC for MPM and should be considered, if necessary, to achieve complete cytoreduction for MPM patients.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Compliance with national guidelines on pancreatic cancer management could improve patient outcomes. Early compliance with the Dutch guideline was poor. The aim was to assess compliance with this guideline during six years after publication. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Nationwide guideline compliance was investigated for three subsequent time periods (2012-2013 vs. 2014-2015 vs. 2016-2017) in patients with pancreatic cancer using five quality indicators in the Netherlands Cancer Registry: 1) discussion in multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT), 2) maximum 3-week interval from final MDT to start of treatment, 3) preoperative biliary drainage when bilirubin &gt;250 μmol/L, 4) use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 5) chemotherapy for inoperable disease (non-metastatic and metastatic). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In total, 14 491 patients were included of whom 2290 (15.8%) underwent resection and 4561 (31.5%) received chemotherapy. Most quality indicators did not change over time: overall, 88.8% of patients treated with curative intent were discussed in a MDT, 42.7% were treated with curative intent within the 3-week interval, 62.7% with a resectable head tumor and bilirubin &gt;250 μmol/L underwent preoperative biliary drainage, 57.2% received chemotherapy after resection, and 36.6% with metastatic disease received chemotherapy. Only use of chemotherapy for non-metastatic, non-resected disease improved over time (23.4% vs. 25.6% vs. 29.7%). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Nationwide compliance to five quality indicators for the guideline on pancreatic cancer management showed little to no improvement during six years after publication. Besides critical review of the current quality indicators, these outcomes may suggest that a nationwide implementation program is required to increase compliance to guideline recommendations.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic surgery may result in changes in pancreatic volume and endocrine function. The effects of pancreatic resection for benign neoplasms on pancreatic volume and endocrine function have not been established yet. This study aimed to investigate the long-term results of different pancreatic surgeries for benign pancreatic neoplasms on pancreatic volume and endocrine function. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The medical records of 30 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and 30 patients who underwent left-sided pancreatectomy(LP) for benign pancreatic neoplasms between 2005 and 2012 were reviewed. The changes in pancreatic volume after pancreatic surgery were assessed using multi-detector row computed tomography volumetry. Endocrine pancreatic function was evaluated on the basis of fasting glucose level or oral glucose tolerance test result. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The median follow-up duration was 91.3 months (interquartile range, 75.7-119.1 months). Reduction in pancreatic volume after surgery was more pronounced in patients who underwent PD than in those who underwent LP (median percentage of volume reduction, 23.8% vs 5.1%, p &lt; .001). Multivariable analysis of prognostic factors for endocrine insufficiency showed that PD to be significant factor. (HR 3.87, 95% CI 1.12-14.66, p = .037). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The surgical methods for benign pancreatic neoplasms affect the reduction in pancreatic volume. Furthermore, the methods of pancreatic surgery were associated with the risk of endocrine insufficiency. Further studies with a large number of patients are warranted to evaluate the association between the degree of volume reduction and the development of endocrine insufficiency.</p>

<p>Hyalinized stroma (HS) is a dense, eosinophilic, and amorphous extracellular material in the stroma. HS is observed in several tumors; however, it has not been comprehensively studied in pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN). Here, we aimed to evaluate the immunohistochemical and microscopic characteristics of HS in IPMN and IOPN. The prevalence of HS was determined in 168 cases of IPMN, including intestinal type (IPMN-I), gastric type (IPMN-G), and pancreatobiliary type (IPMN-PB), as well as in 11 cases of IOPN. Immunohistochemical staining for laminin and collagen (types I, II, III, IV, and V), as well as Congo red staining were performed in IPMN and IOPN cases containing HS. The prevalence of HS among the IPMN and IOPN specimens was 1.2% (2/168 cases) and 45.5% (5/11 cases), respectively. The prevalence rates of HS in each IPMN subtype were as follows: 2.2% (2/91 cases) in IPMN-G, and 0% in IPMN-PB and IPMN-I. All seven HS cases were positive for collagen I, III, IV, and V but were negative for Congo red staining. Most cases showed negative, focal, or weak expression of laminin and type II collagen. These findings indicate that HS is associated with IOPN and is primarily composed of collagen fibers.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study assessed whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with S-1 increases the R0 resection rate in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although a multidisciplinary approach that includes neoadjuvant treatment has been shown to be a better strategy for BRPC than upfront resection, a standard treatment for BRPC has not been established. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A multicenter, single-arm, phase II study was performed. Patients who fulfilled the criteria for BRPC received S-1 (40 mg/m bid) and concurrent radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) before surgery. The primary endpoint was the R0 resection rate. At least 40 patients were required, with a one-sided α = 0.05 and β = 0.05 and expected and threshold values for the primary endpoint of 30% and 10%, respectively. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Fifty-two patients were eligible, and 41 were confirmed to have definitive BRPC by a central review. CRT was completed in 50 (96%) patients and was well tolerated. The rate of grade 3/4 toxicity with CRT was 43%. The R0 resection rate was 52% among the 52 eligible patients and 63% among the 41 patients who were centrally confirmed to have BRPC. Postoperative grade III/IV adverse events according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were observed in 7.5%. Among the 41 centrally confirmed BRPC patients, the 2-year overall survival rate and median overall survival duration were 58% and 30.8 months, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy appear to be feasible and effective at increasing the R0 resection rate and improving survival in patients with BRPC.

<p>KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Direct inhibition of KRAS oncoproteins has been a long-standing pursuit in precision oncology, one established shortly after the discovery of RAS mutations in human cancer cells nearly 40 years ago. Recent advances in medicinal chemistry have established inhibitors targeting KRAS(G12C), a mutation found in ∼13% of lung adenocarcinomas and, at a lower frequency, in other cancers. Preclinical studies describing their discovery and mechanism of action, coupled with emerging clinical data from patients treated with these drugs, have sparked a renewed enthusiasm in the study of KRAS and its therapeutic potential. Here, we discuss how these advances are reshaping the fundamental aspects of KRAS oncoprotein biology and the strides being made toward improving patient outcomes in the clinic.</p>

<p>Intracholecystic neoplasms (ICNs) (pyloric gland adenomas and intracholecystic papillary neoplasms, collectively also called intracholecystic papillary/tubular neoplasms) form multifocal, extensive proliferations on the gallbladder mucosa and have a high propensity for invasion (&gt;50%). In this study, 19 examples of a poorly characterized phenomenon, mural papillary mucinous lesions that arise in adenomyomatous nodules and form localized ICNs, were analyzed. Two of these were identified in 1750 consecutive cholecystectomies reviewed specifically for this purpose, placing its incidence at 0.1%. Median age was 68 years. Unlike other gallbladder lesions, these were slightly more common in men (female/male=0.8), and 55% had documented cholelithiasis. All were characterized by a compact multilocular, demarcated, cystic lesion with papillary proliferations and mucinous epithelial lining. The lesions’ architecture, distribution, location, and typical size were suggestive of evolution from an underlying adenomyomatous nodule. All had gastric/endocervical-like mucinous epithelium, but 5 also had a focal intestinal-like epithelium. Cytologic atypia was graded as 1 to 3 and defined as 1A: mucinous, without cytoarchitectural atypia (n=3), 1B: mild (n=7), 2: moderate (n=2), and 3: severe atypia (n=7, 3 of which also had invasive carcinoma, 16%). Background gallbladder mucosal involvement was absent in all but 2 cases, both of which had multifocal papillary mucosal nodules. In conclusion, these cases highlight a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, mural ICNs arising in adenomyomatous nodules, which, by essentially sparing the “main” mucosa, not displaying “field-effect/defect” phenomenon, and only rarely (16%) showing carcinomatous transformation, are analogous to pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) remains challenging, especially when serum IgG4 is normal or imaging features are indeterminate. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissues as a diagnostic aid for AIP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted until February 2020. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. A random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio and other measures of accuracy. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The meta-analysis included 20 studies comprising 346 patients with AIP and 590 patients with other pancreatobiliary diseases, including 371 pancreatobiliary malignancies. The summary estimates for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls were as follows: diagnostic odds ratio 38.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 18.70-80.75); sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI, 0.59-0.69); specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.95). The area under the curve was 0.939 for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy according to control groups (pancreatobiliary cancer versus other chronic pancreatitis) and sampling site (pancreas versus bile duct/ampulla). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Current data demonstrate that IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissue has a high specificity but moderate sensitivity for diagnosing AIP. IgG4 immunostaining may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of AIP when AIP is clinically suspected, but a combination of imaging and serology does not provide a conclusive diagnosis.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:We evaluated global and regional burdens of, risk factors for, and epidemiologic trends in pancreatic cancer among groups of different sexes and ages. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We used data from the GLOBOCAN database to estimate pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality in 184 countries. We examined the association between lifestyle and metabolic risk factors, extracted from the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory database, and pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality by univariable and multivariable linear regression. We retrieved country-specific on age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence and mortalities from cancer registries from 48 countries through 2017 for trend analysis by joinpoint regression analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The highest incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer were in regions with very high (ASRs, 7.7 and 4.9) and high HDIs (ASRs, 6.9 and 4.6) in 2018. Countries with higher incidence and mortality were more likely to have higher prevalence of smoking, alcohol drinking, physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol. From 2008 to 2017, 2007 to 2016, or 2003 to 2012, depending on the availability of the data, there were increases in incidence among men and women in 14 (average annual percent changes [AAPCs], 8.85 to 0.41) and 17 (AAPCs, 6.04 to 0.87) countries, respectively. For mortality, the increase was observed in eight (AAPCs, 4.20 to 0.55) countries among men and 14 (AAPCs, 5.83 to 0.78) countries among women. While the incidence increased in 18 countries (AAPCs, 7.83 to 0.91) among individuals 50 years or older, an increasing trend in pancreatic cancer was also identified among individuals younger than 50 years and 40 years in eight (AAPCs, 8.75 to 2.82) and four (AAPCs, 11.07 to 8.31) countries, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In an analysis of data from 48 countries, we found increasing incidence and mortality trends in pancreatic cancer, especially among women and populations 50 years or older, but also among younger individuals. More preventive efforts are recommended for these populations.</p>

<p>Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD), or sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare entity characterized by proliferating S100-positive histiocytes. It is most commonly found in lymph nodes with extranodal involvement usually occurring in the head and neck. Pancreatic involvement is extremely rare. The pathology department archives were searched for fine needle aspirations and pancreatic resections showing evidence of RDD. Clinicopathologic features, cytologic smears, cell blocks, immunocytochemical stains and surgical resections were reviewed. Three cases were identified. They were all females, aged 65, 69 and 75, with involvement of the pancreatic tail or head by solid masses of median size 2.3 cm (range 2.1-4.5 cm). Cytologic findings on smears included multiple histiocyte clusters resembling loosely cohesive epithelioid granulomas, singly dispersed histiocytes with moderate to marked nuclear atypia and characteristic emperipolesis. These atypical histiocytes stained positively for CD68, CD163 and S100. Smear background contained variable mixed inflammatory cells, necrotic debris and stromal fragments. The RDD diagnosis was further confirmed on pancreatic resection in two patients and core biopsy in one. The latter patient required three separate procedures before a definitive diagnosis was made. RDD of pancreas is a rare benign inflammatory condition that is diagnostically challenging on cytology. This can cause delays in cytologic diagnosis and/or misdiagnosis. Identification of characteristic cytologic features, primarily histiocytes with emperipolesis, and matching immunocytochemical profile can ensure accurate diagnosis and distinction from mimics.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Integration of palliative care services into the surgical treatment plan is important for holistic patient care. We sought to examine the association between patient race/ethnicity and county-level vulnerability relative to patterns of hospice utilization. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medicare Standard Analytic Files were used to identify patients undergoing lung, esophageal, pancreatic, colon, or rectal cancer surgery between 2013 and 2017. Data were merged with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s social vulnerability index (SVI). Logistic regression was utilized to identify factors associated with overall hospice utilization among deceased individuals. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 54,256 Medicare beneficiaries underwent lung (n = 16,645, 30.7%), esophageal (n = 1427, 2.6%), pancreatic (n = 6183, 11.4%), colon (n = 26,827, 49.4%), or rectal (n = 3174, 5.9%) cancer resection. Median patient age was 76 years (IQR 71-82 years), and 28,887 patients (53.2%) were male; the majority of individuals were White (91.1%, n = 49,443), while a smaller subset was Black or Latino (racial/ethnic minority: n = 4813, 8.9%). Overall, 35,416 (65.3%) patients utilized hospice services prior to death. Median SVI was 52.8 [interquartile range (IQR) 30.3-71.2]. White patients were more likely to utilize hospice care compared with minority patients (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.31, p &lt; 0.001). Unlike White patients, there was reduced odds of hospice utilization (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99) and early hospice initiation (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) as SVI increased among minority patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Patients residing in counties with high social vulnerability were less likely to be enrolled in hospice care at the time of death, as well as be less likely to initiate hospice care early. The effects of increasing social vulnerability on hospice utilization were more profound among minority patients.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To investigate the perioperative and oncologic long-term outcomes of patients with LAPC after surgical resection at a high-volume center for pancreatic surgery. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The role of surgery in LAPC with arterial involvement is controversial. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed 385 consecutive patients undergoing PAR (n = 195) or PAD (n = 190) of the encased artery for LAPC between January 1, 2003 and April 30, 2019. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:There were 183 total pancreatectomies, 113 partial pancreatoduodenectomies, 79 distal pancreatectomies, and 10 resections for tumor recurrences, including 121 multivisceral resections and 171 venous resections. Forty-three patients (11.4%) had resectable oligometastatic disease. All of the 190 patients undergoing PAD (100%) and 95 of the 195 patients undergoing PAR (48.7%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The R0 (circumferential resection margin negative) resection rate was 28%. The median hospital stay was 15 days (range: 3-236). The median survival after surgery for LAPC was 20.1 months and the overall 5-year survival rate 12.5%. In-hospital mortality was 8.8% for the entire patient cohort (n = 385). With increasing case load and growing expertise, there was a significant reduction of in-hospital mortality to 4.8% (n = 186) after 2013 (P = 0.005). The learning curve of experienced pancreatic surgeons for PAR was 15 such procedures. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our data demonstrate that an arterial surgical approach is effective in LAPC with promising long-term survival. PAD after neoadjuvant treatment is safe. PAR is a technically demanding procedure and requires a high level of expertise.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Modern chemotherapeutics have led to improved systemic disease control for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Surgical strategies such as distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) are increasingly entertained. Herein we review procedure-specific outcomes and assess biologic rationale for DP-CAR. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A prospectively maintained single-institution database of all pancreatectomies was queried for patients undergoing DP-CAR. We excluded all patients for whom complete data were not available and those who were not treated with contemporary multi-agent therapy. Data were supplemented with dedicated chart review and outreach for long-term oncologic outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Fifty-four patients underwent DP-CAR between 2008 and 2018. The median age was 62.7 years. Ninety-eight percent received induction chemotherapy. Arterial reconstruction was performed in 17% and concomitant visceral resection in 30%. The R0 resection rate was 87%. Postoperative complications were common (43%) with chyle leak being the most frequent (17%). Length of stay was 8 days, readmission occurred in one-third, and 90-day mortality was 2%. Disease recurrence occurred in 74% during a median follow up of 17.4 months. Median recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9 and 25 months, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Following modern induction paradigms, DP-CAR can be performed with low mortality, manageable morbidity, and excellent rates of margin-negative resection in high-volume settings. The profile of complications of DP-CAR is distinct from pancreaticoduodenectomy and simple distal pancreatectomy. OS and RFS are similar to those undergoing resection of borderline resectable and resectable disease. Improved systemic disease control will likely lead to increasing utilization of aggressive surgical approaches to LAPC.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:RNA-sequencing-based subtyping of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been reported by multiple research groups, each using different methodologies and patient cohorts. “Classical” and “basal-like” PDAC subtypes are associated with survival differences, with basal-like tumors associated with worse prognosis. We amalgamated various PDAC subtyping tools to evaluate the potential of such tools to be reliable in clinical practice. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Sequencing data for 574 PDAC tumors was obtained from prospective trials and retrospective public databases. Six published PDAC subtyping strategies (Moffitt regression tools, clustering-based Moffitt, Collisson, Bailey, and Karasinska subtypes) were used on each sample, and results were tested for subtype call consistency and association with survival. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Basal-like and classical subtype calls were concordant in 88% of patient samples, and survival outcomes were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between prognostic subtypes. Twelve percent of tumors had subtype-discordant calls across the different methods, showing intermediate survival in univariate and multivariate survival analyses. Transcriptional profiles compatible with that of a hybrid subtype signature were observed for subtype-discordant tumors, in which classical and basal-like genes were concomitantly expressed. Subtype-discordant tumors showed intermediate molecular characteristics, including subtyping gene expression (P &lt; 0.0001) and mutant KRAS allelic imbalance (P &lt; 0.001). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Nearly 1 in 6 patients with PDAC have tumors that fail to reliably fall into the classical or basal-like PDAC subtype categories, based on two regression tools aimed toward clinical practice. Rather, these patient tumors show intermediate prognostic and molecular traits. We propose close consideration of the non-binary nature of PDAC subtypes for future incorporation of subtyping into clinical practice.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harbors mutant KRAS as the most common driver mutation. Studies on mouse models have uncovered the tumorigenic characteristics of the Kras oncogene driving pancreatic carcinogenesis. Similarly, Ewing sarcoma predominantly depends on the occurrence of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene. The expression of EWSR1-FLI1 affects pro-tumorigenic pathways and induces cell transformation. In this study, we investigated whether mutant Kras could be exchanged by another potent oncogene, such as EWSR1-FLI1, to initiate pancreatic cancer development. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We generated two conditional mouse models expressing mutant KrasG12D (KC) or the EWSR1-FLI1 oncogene (E/F) in pancreas cells. Pancreatic tissue was collected from the mice at 4-6 weeks and 11-13 weeks of age as well as from survival cohorts to determine the development of spontaneous acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and neoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize and quantify changes in tissue morphology. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The expression of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein in pancreas cells was confirmed by positive FLI1 immunohistochemistry staining. Notably, the EWSR1-FLI1 expression in pancreas cells resulted in a strong depletion of the acinar cell mass and an extensive lipomatosis. Although the E/F mice exhibited spontaneous ADM formation and a shorter overall survival rate compared to KC mice, no development of neoplastic lesion was observed in aging E/F mice. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The expression of the EWSR1-FLI1 oncogene leads to a strong pancreatic atrophy and lipomatosis. ADM formation indicates that pancreatic acinar cells are susceptible for EWSR1-FLI1-mediated oncogenic transformation to a limited extent. However, the EWSR1-FLI1 oncogene is insufficient to induce pancreatic cancer development.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Cancer-associated fibroblasts have emerged to be highly heterogenous and can play multifaced roles in dictating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression, immunosuppression and therapeutic response, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of stromal heterogeneity between patients and even within a single tumor. We hypothesized that image analysis of fibroblast subpopulations and collagen in PDAC tissues might guide stroma-based patient stratification to predict clinical outcomes and tumor characteristics. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A novel multiplex immunohistochemistry-based image analysis system was established to digitally differentiate fibroblast subpopulations. Using whole-tissue slides from 215 treatment-naïve PDACs, we performed concurrent quantification of principal fibroblast subpopulations and collagen and defined three stroma types: collagen-rich stroma, fibroblast activation protein a (FAP)-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma and a smooth muscle actin (ACTA2)-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma. These stroma types were assessed for the associations with cancer-specific survival by multivariable Cox regression analyses, and with clinicopathological factors including CD8+ cell density. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:FAP-dominant fibroblasts and ACTA2-dominant fibroblasts represented the principal distinct fibroblast subpopulations in tumor stroma. Stroma types were associated with patient survival, SMAD4 status and transcriptome signatures. Compared with FAP-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma, collagen-rich stroma correlated with prolonged survival (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.99), while ACTA2-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma exhibited poorer prognosis (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.06-2.58). FAP-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma was additionally characterized by restricted CD8+-cell infiltrates and intense neutrophil infiltration. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study identified three distinct stroma types differentially associated with survival, immunity and molecular features, thereby underscoring the importance of stromal heterogeneity in subtyping pancreatic cancers and supporting the development of anti-stromal therapies.</p>

<p>Label=“AIM” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Weight loss at diagnosis is common in pancreatic cancer (PC) and can adversely affect overall survival (OS). Little is known about the impact of weight loss occurring during palliative treatment. This study aimed to investigate if early weight loss during chemotherapy for inoperable PC affects OS. Label=“METHOD” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This retrospective study included patients newly-diagnosed with inoperable PC. Consecutive patients initiating first-line palliative chemotherapy between Jan’15 - Jan’19 with data on percentage weight loss at week 4 of treatment (%WLWeek4) were eligible. %WLWeek4 was dichotomised using 5% cut-off. OS was measured from chemotherapy initiation. Survival analysis was performed using Cox regression. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Eligible patients (n = 255); 59.2% with head/neck PC; 52.6% metastatic; received triplet (32.2%), doublet (42.7%) or single-agent (25.1%) palliative chemotherapy. Median %WLWeek4 was -2.05% (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.58 to -1.56); %WLWeek4 was ≥5% in 23.1% patients. Patients on triplet chemotherapy were more likely to develop %WLWeek4 of ≥5% [35.4% (triplet) vs. 19.3% (doublet) vs 14.1% (monotherapy); multivariable Odds Ratio (triplet vs monotherapy) =3.25; 95% CI 1.40-7.56; p-value 0.006]. Median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI 8.54-10.41). Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated shorter OS if %WLWeek4 ≥5% (median OS 7.4 months (95% CI 6.27-10.01) vs. 9.9 months (95% CI 9.20-12.05); HR 2.37 (95% CI 1.64-3.42), P &lt; 0.001); this was independent from other factors (stage, age, number of chemotherapy drugs, ECOG-PS), including response to therapy (supporting that %WLWeek4 impacted on OS regardless of response to therapy). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In advanced PC treated with palliative chemotherapy, a %WLWeek4 ≥5% was more prevalent in patients undergoing triplet chemotherapy, and was associated with shorter OS, regardless of response/progression to therapy. Early identification and intervention of weight loss seems to be key to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (HPD) is the only means of achieving R0 resection of widespread extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, its safety and oncological benefit remain controversial because of its inherent high risk of mortality and morbidity. Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze short- and long-term outcomes and evaluate the safety and oncological benefit of this advanced procedure. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The study cohort comprised 37 consecutive patients who had undergone major HPD. Portal vein embolization was performed before surgery in 20 (54%) patients with future remnant liver volume &lt; 35%. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The median operative time and blood loss were 866 min and 1000 mL, respectively. Concomitant vascular resection was performed in five patients (14%). The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 100% and 5.4% (n = 2), respectively. Nineteen patients (51%) had major (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher) complications, the most common being intra-abdominal infection (49%) and post-hepatectomy liver failure (46%, grade B/C: 32%/5%), followed by postoperative pancreatic fistula (30%, grade B/C). R0 resection was achieved in 31 patients (84%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 83%, 48%, and 37%, respectively. In patients with R0 resection, 5-year OS was comparable between patients who had undergone major HPD and major hepatectomy alone (41% vs. 40%, p = non-significant). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:HPD is a valid treatment option for extensive cholangiocarcinoma, offering long-term survival benefit at the cost of relatively high but acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. HPD is advocated in selected patients provided that it is considered possible to achieve R0 resection.</p>

<p>Lung non-small cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the world. Pancreas metastasis from lung cancer is very rare. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) is a useful method to improve the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors and to guide the treatment plan. However, the limited amount of specimen obtained from EUS-FNAB may be a pitfall. Here we present a case of pancreatic metastasis from lung non-small cell carcinoma initially mimicking primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</p>

<p>Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is reported to be a negative prognostic marker in colorectal cancer and is involved in tumorigenesis and progression through several miRNA pathways. In this study, We analyzed its expression in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and explored its relation with survival outcome. 122 patients were enrolled in the study, including 60 cases of GI-NETs, 24 cases of primary hepatic NETs (PHNETs), 16 cases of gallbladder NETs (GBNETs) and 22 cases of pancreatic NETs (pNETs). IHC was performed for DCLK1 on tumor tissue. All patients underwent a baseline visit, histologic determination, and a follow-up for survival. In the 60 cases of GI-NETs, DCLK1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic expression. The positive rates of DCLK1, Syn and CgA were 100% (60/60), 100% (60/60) and 36.7% (22/60), respectively. However, DCLK1 showed negative staining in all of the 62 cases of PHNETs, GBNETs, and pNETs. The mean score of DCLK1, Syn, and CgA were (5.77±2.012), (5.13±2.078) and (2.68±2.797), respectively. DCLK1 was correlated with primary site (P&lt;0.001) and Syn expression (P = 0.045). Additionally, in GI-NETs, we found that DCLK1 expression was associated with worse OS (log-rank = 5.212, P = 0.022). The divergent expression of DCLK1 in NETs suggests different functional roles of DCLK1 in different locations of NET within the digestive system. However, with the limited number of tumor samples, its outcome prediciton still needs further investigation. DCLK1 expression may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of GI-NETs.</p>

<p>Histopathologically scoring the response of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to neoadjuvant treatment can guide the selection of adjuvant therapy and improve prognostic stratification. However, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems exist, and consensus is lacking as to which system represents best practice. An international consensus meeting on TRS took place in November 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, we provide an overview of the outcomes and consensus statements that originated from this meeting. Consensus (≥80% agreement) was reached on a total of seven statements: (1) TRS is important because it provides information about the effect of neoadjuvant treatment that is not provided by other histopathology-based descriptors. (2) TRS for resected PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy should assess residual (viable) tumor burden instead of tumor regression. (3) The CAP scoring system is considered the most adequate scoring system to date because it is based on the presence and amount of residual cancer cells instead of tumor regression. (4) The defining criteria of the categories in the CAP scoring system should be improved by replacing subjective terms including “minimal” or “extensive” with objective criteria to evaluate the extent of viable tumor. (5) The improved, consensus-based system should be validated retrospectively and prospectively. (6) Prospective studies should determine the extent of tissue sampling that is required to ensure adequate assessment of the residual cancer burden, taking into account the heterogeneity of tumor response. (7) In future scientific publications, the extent of tissue sampling should be described in detail in the “Materials and methods” section.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Continuing recalcitrance to therapy cements pancreatic cancer (PC) as the most lethal malignancy, which is set to become the second leading cause of cancer death in our society. The study aim was to investigate the association between DNA damage response (DDR), replication stress, and novel therapeutic response in PC to develop a biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy targeting DDR and replication stress in PC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We interrogated the transcriptome, genome, proteome, and functional characteristics of 61 novel PC patient-derived cell lines to define novel therapeutic strategies targeting DDR and replication stress. Validation was done in patient-derived xenografts and human PC organoids. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Patient-derived cell lines faithfully recapitulate the epithelial component of pancreatic tumors, including previously described molecular subtypes. Biomarkers of DDR deficiency, including a novel signature of homologous recombination deficiency, cosegregates with response to platinum (P &lt; .001) and PARP inhibitor therapy (P &lt; .001) in vitro and in vivo. We generated a novel signature of replication stress that predicts response to ATR (P &lt; .018) and WEE1 inhibitor (P &lt; .029) treatment in both cell lines and human PC organoids. Replication stress was enriched in the squamous subtype of PC (P &lt; .001) but was not associated with DDR deficiency. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Replication stress and DDR deficiency are independent of each other, creating opportunities for therapy in DDR-proficient PC and after platinum therapy.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Diagnosing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia without invasion, traditionally referred to as carcinoma in situ (CIS), is essential for improving prognosis. We examined the imaging findings of patients with and without CIS to identify significant aspects for the diagnosis of CIS. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Forty-six patients strongly suspected of early pancreatic cancer without nodule on imaging (CIS group, n = 27; non-malignant group, n = 19) were retrospectively evaluated according to ten factors of computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using hierarchical cluster and univariate analyses. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Two clusters were formed by hierarchical cluster analysis. One cluster consisted of 83.3% CIS cases with similar image findings such as focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy (FPPA) on CT/MRI, main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas on EUS, and MPD stricture with upstream MPD dilation on ERCP. On univariate analysis, the CIS and non-malignant groups had FPPA on CT/MRI in 15 (55.6%) and 3 (15.8%) cases (p = 0.013), and MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas on EUS in 20 (74.1%) and 4 (21.1%) cases (p = 0.001), respectively. MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas was observed in 80% (12/15) of CIS cases with FPPA on CT/MRI and correlated with FPPA. Moreover, FPPA and MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas had histopathologically observed fibrosis or fat replacement due to pancreatic parenchymal atrophy. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:FPPA and MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas are significant findings for the diagnosis of CIS.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:We recently reported prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4), a potential tumor suppressor protein restrains epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties and promotes mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) in invasive cancer cells by repressing Twist-1 promoter activity. Here, we demonstrate that genetic as well as pharmacological modulation of Par-4 by NGD16 (a small molecule antimetastatic agent), limits EMT-induced chemoresistance in aggressive cancer cells by suppressing MDM-2, a downstream effector of Twist-1. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Matrigel invasion assay, gelatin degradation assay, cell scattering assay, MTT assay and colony formation assay were used to study the proliferation and migration abilities of invasive cancer cells. Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation analysis were utilized for determining protein expression and protein-protein interaction. 4T1 aggressive mouse carcinoma model was employed to evaluate tumor growth and lung metastasis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Treatment of gemcitabine (nucleoside analogue anticancer agent) to pancreatic cancer (Panc-1, MiaPaca-2) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells amplified MDM-2 expression along with increase in EMT properties. Conversely, NGD16 boosted expression of tumor suppressor Par-4 and inhibited invasion and migration abilities of these cells. Moreover, induction of Par-4 effectively diminished MDM-2 along with pro-EMT markers, whereas, augmented the expression of epithelial markers. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of Par-4 divulged that NGD16 exerts its EMT inhibitory effects in a Par-4-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Par-4 activation provokes p53 by disrupting MDM-2-p53 interaction, which restored epithelial characteristics in cancer cells. Additionally, partial knockdown of MDM-2 through siRNA pronounced the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of NGD16. Finally, NGD16 efficiently inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse mammary carcinoma model without showing any undesirable effects. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our findings unveil Par-4 as a key therapeutic target and NGD16 (the pharmacological modulator of Par-4) are potential tools to suppress EMT and associated chemoresistance, which could be exploited clinically for the treatment of aggressive cancers.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. There is an unmet need to develop strategies to detect PaCa at an early, operable stage and prevent its progression. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic PaCa precursors that comprise nearly 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally via cross-sectional imaging. Since IPMNs can progress from low- and moderate-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasion, the study of these lesions offers a prime opportunity to develop early detection and prevention strategies. Organoids are an ideal preclinical platform to study IPMNs, and the objective of the current investigation was to establish a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from IPMNs. IPMN tumors and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were successfully harvested from 15 patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic surgical resection at Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute (Tampa, FL) between May of 2017 and March of 2019. Organoid cultures were also generated from cryopreserved tissues. Organoid count and size were determined over time by both Image-Pro Premier 3D Version 9.1 digital platform and Matlab application of a Circular Hough Transform algorithm, and histologic and genomic characterization of a subset of the organoids was performed using immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing, respectively. The success rates for organoid generation from IPMN tumor and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were 81% and 87%, respectively. IPMN organoids derived from different epithelial subtypes showed different morphologies in vitro, and organoids recapitulated histologic and genomic characteristics of the parental IPMN tumor. In summary, this preclinical model has the potential to provide new opportunities to unveil mechanisms of IPMN progression to invasion and to shed insight into novel biomarkers for early detection and targets for chemoprevention.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Despite substantial morbidity and mortality associated with acute pancreatitis (AP), only one small randomized controlled drug trial (RCT) is available in the past few decades from the United States. Hence, we conducted a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of pentoxifylline in AP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 9 doses of oral pentoxifylline 400 mg or placebo tablet, three times daily, was administered within 72 h of diagnosis, using randomization blocks by pharmacy. Primary outcome was a composite outcome including any of the following: death, peripancreatic and/or pancreatic necrosis, infected pancreatic necrosis, persistent organ failure, persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome, hospital stay longer than 4 days, need for intensive care, and need for intervention for necrosis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Between July 7, 2015, and April 4, 2017, we identified 685 patients with AP, 233 met eligibility criteria and 176 were approached for the study. Of these, 91 (51.7%) declined and finally 45 in pentoxifylline group and 38 in placebo group (83 total) were compared. There were no significant differences in primary outcome (27 [60.0%] vs 15 [39.5%]; P = .06). Pentoxifylline group was not associated with any benefit, but withlonger stay (42% vs. 21%; P = .04) and higher readmission rates (16 %vs 3%; P = .047). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We could not demonstrate superiority of pentoxifylline over placebo. Smaller sample size and inclusion of all types of severity might be the reasons for lack of efficacy. The challenges observed in the present study indicate that, in order to conduct a successful drug trial in AP, a multi center collaboration is essential.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The ABO blood group may influence the development and progression of cancer. In particular, the prognosis of patients with blood type O is better for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although this has not been extensively explored in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET). Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To assess the influence of the ABO and Rhesus blood types on the risk of recurrence in patients who underwent curative intent PanNET surgical resection. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:All consecutive patients operated on for well-differentiated panNET in an expert center from 2003 to 2018 were retrospectively included. Blood group, Rhesus system, demographic and clinical data were collected. The primary endpoint was recurrence free survival (RFS). Factors associated with RFS were explored using Cox proportional hazard models. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, 300 patients (male 43%) were included, median age 54 years old (IQR 45-64). The ABO blood group distribution was similar to that of the French population. There was no association between blood group and tumor features. The median postoperative follow-up was 43.9 months (17.0-77.8). The 5- and 10-year RFS rates were 85 ± 4% and 71 ± 13% in O RhD + patients, versus 72 ± 4% and 63 ± 6% otherwise, respectively (p = 0.035). The O RhD + blood group was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (HR 0.34, 95% CI [0.15-0.75]), p = 0.007 in multivariable analysis adjusted for age, ki67, functioning syndrome, resection margins, tumor size, lymph node status, oncogenetic syndrome. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:After curative-intent surgical resection for PanNET, patients with a non-O RhD + blood group may have an increased risk of recurrence and could benefit from closer follow-up.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is considered a potential approach to improve survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA). The objective of this study was to identify the clinical implications of washing peritoneal cytology (CY) status after NAT. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Between 2005 and 2016, 151 consecutive patients with resectable (R)/borderline resectable (BR) PA underwent NAT with intention of subsequent resection at our institution. Of them, 13 and 123 patients underwent pancreatectomies with positive (CY+) and negative (CY-) cytology, respectively, while the remaining 15 patients did not undergo resection due to gross metastases at laparotomy. The clinicopathological factors influencing overall survival were clarified by the uni- and multivariate analyses. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were markedly worse in patients who underwent resection with CY+, compared with those who were CY- (median OS, 14.8 m vs 30.8 m, p = 0.026, and median DFS 6.0 m vs 15.1 m, p = 0.008). According to the resectability by NCCN guidelines, CY+ indicates worse prognosis than CY- in R-PA patients (mOS: 30.1 m vs 71.1 m: p = 0.080). Similarly, in BR-PA patients, CY+ showed the significantly worse prognosis than CY- (mOS: 13.8 m vs 24.5 m: p = 0.048), which prognosis is comparable with patients who did not undergo resection. The multivariate analysis revealed that resectability, CY status and the induction of adjuvant therapy were significant predictors of postoperative OS (p = 0.007: Hazard ratio 2.264, 0.040:2.094 and 0.002:3.246, respectively). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:CY+ is a significant predictor of poorer prognosis in PA patients after NAT. The subsequent pancreatectomies with CY+ after NAT do not contribute to prolonged survival.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND”:The pancreas is small and irregular in shape in people with type 2 diabetes. If these abnormalities are caused by the disease state itself rather than being a predisposing factor, remission of type 2 diabetes should restore normal pancreas morphology. The objective of this study was to determine whether changes in pancreas volume and shape occurred during 2 years of remission. Label=“METHODS”:For this post-hoc analysis, we included a subset of adult participants of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), who had type 2 diabetes and were randomly assigned to a weight management intervention or routine diabetes management. Intervention group participants were categorised as responders (HbA1c &lt;6·5% [48 mmol/mol] and fasting blood glucose &lt;7·0 mmol/L, off all anti-diabetes medication) and non-responders, who were classified as remaining diabetic. Data on pancreas volume and irregularity of pancreas border at baseline, 5 months, 12 months, and 24 months after intervention were compared between responders and non-responders; additional comparisons were made between control group participants with type 2 diabetes and a non-diabetic comparator (NDC) group, who were matched to the intervention group by age, sex, and post-weight-loss weight, to determine the extent of any normalisation. We used a mixed-effects regression model based on repeated measures ANOVA with correction for potential confounding. Magnetic resonance techniques were employed to quantify pancreas volume, the irregularity of the pancreas borders, and intrapancreatic fat content. β-cell function and biomarkers of tissue growth were also measured. Label=“FINDINGS”:Between July 25, 2015, and Aug 5, 2016, 90 participants with type 2 diabetes in the DiRECT subset were randomly assigned to intervention (n=64) or control (n=26) and were assessed at baseline; a further 25 non-diabetic participants were enrolled into the NDC group. At baseline, mean pancreas volume was 61·7 cm3 (SD 16·0) in all participants with type 2 diabetes and 79·8 cm3 (14·3) in the NDC group (p&lt;0·0001). At 24 months, pancreas volume had increased by 9·4 cm3 (95% CI 6·1 to 12·8) in responders compared with 6·4 cm3 (2·5 to 10·3) in non-responders (p=0·0008). Pancreas borders at baseline were more irregular in participants with type 2 diabetes than in the NDC group (fractal dimension 1·138 [SD 0·027] vs 1·097 [0·025]; p&lt;0·0001) and had normalised by 24 months in responders only (1·099 [0·028]). Intrapancreatic fat declined by 1·02 percentage points (95% CI 0·53 to 1·51) in 32 responders and 0·51% (-0·17 to 1·19) in 13 non-responders (p=0·23). Label=“INTERPRETATION”:These data show for the first time, to our knowledge, reversibility of the abnormal pancreas morphology of type 2 diabetes by weight loss-induced remission.

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are non-invasive precursor lesions that can progress to invasive pancreatic cancer and are classified as low-grade or high-grade based on the morphology of the neoplastic epithelium. We aimed to compare genetic alterations in low-grade and high-grade regions of the same IPMN in order to identify molecular alterations underlying neoplastic progression. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We performed multiregion whole exome sequencing on tissue samples from 17 IPMNs with both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia (76 IPMN regions, including 49 from low-grade dysplasia and 27 from high-grade dysplasia). We reconstructed the phylogeny for each case, and we assessed mutations in a novel driver gene in an independent cohort of 63 IPMN cyst fluid samples. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Our multiregion whole exome sequencing identified KLF4, a previously unreported genetic driver of IPMN tumorigenesis, with hotspot mutations in one of two codons identified in &gt;50% of the analyzed IPMNs. Mutations in KLF4 were significantly more prevalent in low-grade regions in our sequenced cases. Phylogenetic analyses of whole exome sequencing data demonstrated diverse patterns of IPMN initiation and progression. Hotspot mutations in KLF4 were also identified in an independent cohort of IPMN cyst fluid samples, again with a significantly higher prevalence in low-grade IPMNs. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Hotspot mutations in KLF4 occur at high prevalence in IPMNs. Unique among pancreatic driver genes, KLF4 mutations are enriched in low-grade IPMNs. These data highlight distinct molecular features of low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and suggest diverse pathways to high-grade dysplasia via the IPMN pathway.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is challenging. Sonographic and cross-sectional imaging findings of AIP closely mimic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and techniques for tissue sampling of AIP are suboptimal. These limitations often result in delayed or failed diagnosis, which negatively impact patient management and outcomes. This study aimed to create an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to differentiate AIP from PDAC, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal pancreas (NP), with sufficient performance to analyse EUS video in real time. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A database of still image and video data obtained from EUS examinations of cases of AIP, PDAC, CP and NP was used to develop a CNN. Occlusion heatmap analysis was used to identify sonographic features the CNN valued when differentiating AIP from PDAC. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:From 583 patients (146 AIP, 292 PDAC, 72 CP and 73 NP), a total of 1 174 461 unique EUS images were extracted. For video data, the CNN processed 955 EUS frames per second and was: 99% sensitive, 98% specific for distinguishing AIP from NP; 94% sensitive, 71% specific for distinguishing AIP from CP; 90% sensitive, 93% specific for distinguishing AIP from PDAC; and 90% sensitive, 85% specific for distinguishing AIP from all studied conditions (ie, PDAC, CP and NP). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The developed EUS-CNN model accurately differentiated AIP from PDAC and benign pancreatic conditions, thereby offering the capability of earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Use of this model offers the potential for more timely and appropriate patient care and improved outcome.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To compare the clinical characteristics and overall survival (OS) of germline mutation carriers in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes and noncarriers with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Germline DNA from 3,078 patients with PDAC enrolled in a prospective registry at Mayo Clinic between 2000 and 2017 was analyzed for mutations in 37 cancer predisposition genes. Characteristics and OS of patients with mutations in eight genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D) involved in HRR were compared with patients testing negative for mutations in all 37 genes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The 175 HRR mutation carriers and 2,730 noncarriers in the study had a median duration of follow-up of 9.9 years. HRR mutation carriers were younger (median age at diagnosis: 63 vs. 66 years, P &lt; 0.001) and more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis (46% vs. 36%, P = 0.004). In a multivariable model adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, and tumor staging, patients with germline HRR mutations had a significantly longer OS compared with noncarriers [HR, 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70-0.97; P = 0.02]. Further gene-level analysis demonstrated that germline ATM mutation carriers had longer OS compared with patients without germline mutations in any of the 37 genes (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.94; P = 0.01). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study demonstrates that germline mutation carrier status in PDAC is associated with longer OS compared with noncarriers. Further research into tumor biology and response to platinum-based chemotherapy in germline mutation carriers with PDAC are needed to better understand the association with longer OS.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a serious complication after gastric cancer surgery. The current study aimed to investigate the significance of the anatomic location of the pancreas as a predictor for POPF in both laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and open gastrectomy (OG). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In total, 233 patients with gastric cancer were assessed retrospectively. We measured the maximum vertical (P-L height; PLH) and horizontal length (P-L depth; PLD) between the upper border of pancreas and the root of left gastric artery on a preoperative CT in the sagittal direction. The maximum length of the vertical line between the surface of the pancreas and the aorta (P-A length), previously reported as prognostic factor of POPF, was also measured. We investigated the correlations between these parameters and the incidence of POPF in LG and OG groups. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among the patients in this study, 118 underwent OG and 115 underwent LG. In LG, the median PLH and P-A length in patients with POPF were significantly longer compared with those without POPF (p = 0.026, 0.034, respectively), but not in OG. There was no significant difference in the median PLD between the patients with or without POPF in both LG and OG. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that PLH (odds ratio [OR] 4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-11.3, P = 0.004) and P-A length (OR 4.06, 95%CI 1.05-15.7, P = 0.042] were independent factors for predicting POPF in LG. However, intraoperative blood loss (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.05-6.18, P = 0.038) was extracted as an independent factor in OG. The median amylase level in the drained fluid (D-Amy) were significantly higher in patients with high PLH(≥12.4 mm) or high P-A length (≥45 mm) compared with those with low PLH or low P-A length in LG. However, there were no differences in the D-Amy levels by PLH or P-A length in OG patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The anatomic location of the pancreas is a specific and independent predictor of POPF in LG but not in OG. PLH is a simple parameter that can evaluate the anatomic position of the pancreas, and it may be useful for preventing POPF after LG.</p>

<p>Currently there is no highly specific and sensitive marker to identify breast cancer-the most common malignancy in women. Breast cancer can be categorized as estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive luminal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) types based on the expression of ER, PR, and HER2. Although GATA3 is the most widely used tumor marker at present to determine the breast origin, which has been shown to be an excellent marker for ER-positive and low-grade breast cancer, but it does not work well for TNBC with sensitivity as low as &lt;20% in metaplastic breast carcinoma. In the current study, through TCGA data mining we identified trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) as a specific gene for breast carcinoma across 31 solid tumor types. Moreover, high mRNA level of TRPS1 was found in all four subtypes of breast carcinoma including ER/PR-positive luminal A and B types, HER2-positive type, and basal-type/TNBC. We then analyzed TRPS1 expression in 479 cases of various types of breast cancer using immunochemistry staining, and found that TRPS1 and GATA3 had comparable positive expression in ER-positive (98% vs. 95%) and HER2-positive (87% vs. 88%) breast carcinomas. However, TRPS1 which was highly expressed in TNBC, was significantly higher than GATA3 expression in metaplastic (86% vs. 21%) and nonmetaplastic (86% vs. 51%) TNBC. In addition, TRPS1 expression was evaluated in 1234 cases of solid tumor from different organs. In contrast to the high expression of GATA3 in urothelial carcinoma, TRPS1 showed no or little expression in urothelial carcinomas or in other tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colon and gastric adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. These findings suggest that TRPS1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for breast carcinoma and can be used as a great diagnostic tool, especially for TNBC.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite the high prevalence of Kras mutations in pancreatic cancer patients, murine models expressing the oncogenic mutant Kras (Krasmut) in mature pancreatic cells develop PDAC at a low frequency. Independent of cell of origin, a second genetic hit (loss of tumor suppressor TP53 or PTEN) is important for development of PDAC in mice. We hypothesized ectopic expression and elevated levels of oncogenic mutant Kras would promote PanIN arising in pancreatic ducts. To test our hypothesis, the significance of elevating levels of K-Ras and Ras activity has been explored by expression of a CAG driven LGSL-KrasG12V allele (cKras) in pancreatic ducts, which promotes ectopic Kras expression. We predicted expression of cKras in pancreatic ducts would generate neoplasia and PDAC. To test our hypothesis, we employed tamoxifen dependent CreERT2 mediated recombination. Hnf1b:CreERT2;KrasG12V (cKrasHnf1b/+) mice received 1 (Low), 5 (Mod) or 10 (High) mg per 20 g body weight to recombine cKras in low (cKrasLow), moderate (cKrasMod), and high (cKrasHigh) percentages of pancreatic ducts. Our histologic analysis revealed poorly differentiated aggressive tumors in cKrasHigh mice. cKrasMod mice had grades of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN), recapitulating early and advanced PanIN observed in human PDAC. Proteomics analysis revealed significant differences in PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways between wild type, cKrasLow, cKrasMod, and cKrasHigh mice. In conclusion, in this study, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in pancreatic ducts generates early and late PanIN as well as PDAC. This Ras rheostat model provides evidence that AKT signaling is an important early driver of invasive ductal derived PDAC.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The impact of glycemic status and insulin resistance on the risk of pancreatic cancer in the nondiabetic population remains uncertain. We aimed to examine the association of glycemic status and insulin resistance with pancreatic cancer mortality in individuals with and without diabetes. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This is a cohort study of 572,021 Korean adults without cancer at baseline, who participated in repeat screening examinations which included fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin, and were followed for a median of 8.4 years (interquartile range, 5.3 -13.2 years). Vital status and pancreatic cancer mortality were ascertained through linkage to national death records. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:During 5,211,294 person-years of follow-up, 260 deaths from pancreatic cancer were identified, with a mortality rate of 5.0 per 10 person-years. In the overall population, the risk of pancreatic cancer mortality increased with increasing levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c in a dose-response manner, and this association was observed even in individuals without diabetes. In nondiabetic individuals without previously diagnosed or screen-detected diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were positively associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality. Specifically, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for pancreatic cancer mortality comparing the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.49 (1.08-2.05), and the corresponding hazard ratio comparing the insulin ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.43 (1.05-1.95). These associations remained significant when introducing changes in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and other confounders during follow-up as time-varying covariates. Label=“DISCUSSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Glycemic status, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, even in individuals without diabetes, were independently associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The impact on clinical practice of the international guidelines including the Sendai Guidelines (SG06) and Fukuoka Guidelines (FG12) on the management of cystic lesions of the pancreas (CLP) has not been well-studied. The primary aim was to examine the changing trends and outcomes in the surgical management of CLP in our institution over time and to determine the impact of these guidelines on our institution practice. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:462 patients with surgically-treated CLP were retrospectively reviewed and classified under the 2 guidelines. The cohort was divided into 3 time periods: 1998-2006, 2007-2012 and 2013 to 2018. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Comparison across the 3 time periods demonstrated significantly increasing frequency of older patients, asymptomatic CLP, male gender, smaller tumor size, elevated Ca 19-9, use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) prior to surgery. There was also significantly increasing frequency of adherence to the international guidelines as evidenced by the increasing proportion of HRSG06 and HRFG12 CLP with a corresponding lower proportion of LRSG06 and LRFG12 being resected. This resulted in a significantly higher proportion of resected CLP whereby the final pathology confirmed that a surgery was actually indicated. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Over time, there was increasing adherence to the international guidelines for the selection of patients for surgical resection as evidenced by the significantly increasing proportion of HRSG06 and HRFG06 CLPs undergoing surgery. This was associated with a significantly higher proportion of patients with a definitive indication for surgery. These suggested that over time, there was a continuous improvement in our selection of appropriate CLP for surgical treatment.</p>
