Tumors located exclusively in the deep lobe are not common and 20% of parotid gland tumors originate from deep lobe under the branches of the facial nerve. Accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) procedure in salivary gland tumors have been studied extensively, however there isn't any data regarding usefulness of FNAB in tumors located exclusively in deep lobe of parotid gland. In this study we aimed to assess the use of FNAB in deep lobe parotid tumors.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with deep lobe parotid tumors who underwent surgery in our clinic between January 2013-December 2018. Characteristics of patients were recorded. Preoperative FNAB results and postoperative final histopathologic diagnosis were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 24.0 was used for statistical analysis.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The number of patients that met the inclusion criteria was 51. The mean age of patients were 49.2(14-86). In 40 (78.4) of the patients, tumor was reported as benign and in 11 (21.6) patients FNAB diagnosis was suspicious for malignancy, malignant or non-diagnostic. In final histopathologic diagnosis, 42 of the tumors were benign and 9 were malignant. The most common benign tumor type was pleomorphic adenoma which constitutes 27 of the cases (52.9%). Regarding detection of malignant disease, the sensitivity of FNAB was 90.4%, specificity was 77.7%, positive predictive value was 95%, negative predictive value was 63.6%. There was a substantial agreement between FNAB and final histopathologic diagnosis(kappa = 0,628).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":FNAB is a safe and reliable tool to evaluate deep lobe parotid tumors. It is an important part of preoperative surgical planning and can help the surgeon in patient counseling. FNAB with ultrasound guidance is recommended for deep lobe tumors.",eng,Am J Otolaryngol,8000029,0196-0709,ppublish,33045535,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102590,42,1,Am J Otolaryngol

Here we report that activin-A, after binding to its cognate receptors induces a functional luteolytic state and reverses luteinization phenotype by downregulating the expression of the steroidogenic enzymes, LH receptor and VEGF and reducing estradiol (E2) progesterone (P4) production and upregulating FSH receptor and cyclin D1 expression in human primary luteinized granulosa cells. Further, this action of activin-A involves downregulation of JNK signaling pathway and is opposite to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which acts as a luteotropic hormone and improves luteal function through the activation of JNK pathway in the same cell type. Reversal of luteinization phenotype in luteal granulosa cells by activin-A potentially makes this hormone an attractive candidate for use under certain clinical situations, where induction of luteolysis and rapid reduction of endogenous sex steroid levels are beneficial such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), in which the ovaries hyper-respond to gonadotropin stimulation by producing too many growing follicles along with development of ascites, pleural effusion, and hemo-concentrations as a result of increased vascular permeability and leakage of intravascular volume into third spaces.

However, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems exist, and consensus is lacking as to which system represents best practice. An international consensus meeting on TRS took place in November 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, we provide an overview of the outcomes and consensus statements that originated from this meeting. Consensus (≥80% agreement) was reached on a total of seven statements: (1) TRS is important because it provides information about the effect of neoadjuvant treatment that is not provided by other histopathology-based descriptors. (2) TRS for resected PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy should assess residual (viable) tumor burden instead of tumor regression. (3) The CAP scoring system is considered the most adequate scoring system to date because it is based on the presence and amount of residual cancer cells instead of tumor regression. (4) The defining criteria of the categories in the CAP scoring system should be improved by replacing subjective terms including &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot; with objective criteria to evaluate the extent of viable tumor. (5) The improved, consensus-based system should be validated retrospectively and prospectively. (6) Prospective studies should determine the extent of tissue sampling that is required to ensure adequate assessment of the residual cancer burden, taking into account the heterogeneity of tumor response.

The protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase-1 (NQO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were measured with ELISA; the immunopositivity of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and caspase 3 were determined with immunohistochemistry; the mRNA transcript levels of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase 3, protein kinase B1/2 (Akt-1/2), and forkhead box transcription factor, class O1 (FOXO1) were determined with RT-PCR. The reduction of Nrf2 levels and HO-1 and NQO1 activities in the sciatic nerve tissue, the increase in the levels of 8-OHdG, and the increase in the levels of GFAP and NF-κB caused by vincristine was observed to cause oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, neuronal cell damage, and inflammation, respectively. Additionally, vincristine was determined to cause ER stress and apoptosis by increasing PERK, IRE1, ATF-6, and GRP78 and caspase 3 and Bax expressions and by decreasing Bcl-2 expressions. Vincristine causing Akt inhibition also shows that it prevents neuronal survival.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Median duration of disease onset after the ABS was 16 (8-38) months. After the diagnosis of GM was obtained, all patients received steroid treatment. Median steroid treatment duration was 10 (8-20) weeks. Methotrexate was administered in two patients due to persistent breast mass and steroid side effect. Surgical excision was performed in three patients with wide excision. No patient needed further surgery such as mastectomy. Median follow-up period was 37.5 (18-70) months.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This is the first study to declare GM in patients who underwent ABS. Atypical clinical presentation such as breast abscess, mass or fistula after ABS should alert the surgeon about GM. Unlike other mastitis, the primary treatment of this rare disease is steroid and immunosuppressive treatment. Insufficient knowledge about GM can lead to unnecessary surgeries or breast loss.

To determine why individuals with MRS specifically lack pancreatic endocrine cells, we micro-CT imaged a 12-week-old foetus homozygous for the nonsense mutation RFX6 c.1129C&gt;T, which revealed loss of the pancreas body and tail. From this foetus, we derived iPSCs and show that differentiation of these cells in vitro proceeds normally until generation of pancreatic endoderm, which is significantly reduced. We additionally generated an RFX6HA reporter allele by gene targeting in wild-type H9 cells to precisely define RFX6 expression and in parallel performed in situ hybridisation for RFX6 in the dorsal pancreatic bud of a Carnegie stage 14 human embryo. Both in vitro and in vivo, we find that RFX6 specifically labels a subset of PDX1-expressing pancreatic endoderm. In summary, RFX6 is essential for efficient differentiation of pancreatic endoderm, and its absence in individuals with MRS specifically impairs formation of endocrine cells of the pancreas head and tail.",eng,Development,8701744,0950-1991,epublish,33033118,10.1242/dev.194878,147,21,Development

An experimental study.,10.1080/2000656X.2020.1828901,"Recently, most of the immediate breast reconstructions following mastectomy are being carried out with the use of silicone implants. In these patients, methylene blue is being used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. This experimental study was performed to determine the effect of methylene blue on capsular contracture around breast implants. Thirty-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Custom made silicone blocks were placed on the back of animals. In group 1, the incision was closed without performing any additional procedure. In group 2 (control), 0.1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was instilled into the pocket. Group 3 and 4 (study groups) received 0.1 and 0.2 mL of 1% methylene blue, respectively. On postoperative day 60, implants and capsular tissue were extracted. Capsule formation was evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. The histological evaluation included capsule thickness, inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis gradients. Regarding capsule thickness, there were statistically significant differences between groups 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, and 2-4. Although there were more moderate and severe inflammation gradients in groups III and IV, there was no significant difference regarding inflammation severity between control and study groups. In respect of vascular proliferation, there was a statistically significant difference between control and study groups. Similarly, fibrosis gradients were higher in both groups 3 and 4. The study showed that the injection of methylene blue around silicone implants enhanced the formation of capsular contracture. In this case, the degree of contracture was independent of the dose given.

We aimed to assess the association of tumour markers with histopathological structure of ovarian endometriomas to assess their roles in clinical management. Data from 86 women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma were evaluated. The possible risk factors for inadvertently removed normal ovarian parenchyma (IRNOP) during laparoscopic cystectomy and the relationship between tumour markers and histopathologic parameters of ovarian endometrioma were assessed. Age and the depth of penetration of endometrial tissue into the cyst wall showed a significant positive correlation with thickness of IRNOP. There was a significant negative correlation between IRNOP and the thickness of fibrosis on cyst wall. Thickness of fibrosis and the depth of penetration represented significant positive correlations with tumour markers (CA 125, CA 15-3, and CA 19-9), respectively. This is the first study that reveals the association between tumour markers and the histopathologic features of ovarian endometrioma. The outcome of the present study indicated that lower levels of tumour markers may permit a conservative management, rising levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and high levels may help in counselling postoperative outcomes. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Endometriosis is defined as a benign gynaecologic disease, and the vast majority of women who suffer from endometriosis are of reproductive age. Ovarian endometriotic cysts are found in one-fifth to one-half of patients with endometriosis. Laparoscopic cystectomy is accepted as the gold standard for the surgical management of ovarian endometriotic cysts because of the procedure's several clinical advantages, such as lower recurrence and higher pregnancy rates. However, studies have indicated that laparoscopic excision of an ovarian endometrioma capsule could be associated with a reduction in both the ovarian volume and the follicle count. What do the results of this study add? Our retrospective data indicate that tumour markers may have role in planning the management of ovarian endometriomas. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Low tumour markers levels may permit a conservative management, elevating levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and finally high levels may help in counselling the patient about her possible postoperative outcomes.",eng,J Obstet Gynaecol,8309140,0144-3615,aheadofprint,33054460,10.1080/01443615.2020.1791060,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":During the study period, 89 children met the inclusion criteria. Patients were followed for a median of 8.0 years. A total of 39 (44%) patients were diagnosed with EGID after transplantation. Of these, 29 (33%) had eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and 10 (11%) had eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis. In comparison with the non-EGID group, patients with EGID were younger at transplant (P ≤ 0.0001), transplanted more frequently due to biliary atresia (P ≤ 0.0001), and had higher rates of pretransplant allergy (P = 0.019). In the posttransplant period, they had higher rates of mammalian Target of Rapamycin inhibitor use (P = 0.006), Epstein-Barr virus viremia (P = 0.03), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (P = 0.005), and allergen sensitization (P ≤ 0.0001). In regression analysis, young age at transplant, age at diagnosis, pretransplant atopic dermatitis, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease were associated with an increased risk of EGID or EoE. Laboratory abnormalities such as anemia (P = 0.007), thrombocytosis (P = 0.012), and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.031) were more commonly observed in the eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis group than in the EoE group.

Plasma samples were collected on the same day of diagnosis and before any immunosuppressive treatment was initiated. At the time of diagnosis and sample collection, none of the patients had renal involvement. We used Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) to investigate the alterations in plasma metabolomic profiles. Three separate pools were created: healthy controls (group C), active IgAV patients who did not develop renal involvement (group H), and patients who developed IgAVN at follow up (group N).

Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Retrospective database research was conducted. Sixty nine meningioma and 15 schwannoma having DSC-PI between January 2016 and February 2020 were included. Time to signal intensity curves (TSIC) were analyzed and grouped as T1-dominant leakage, T2*-dominant leakage and return to baseline. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative mean transit time (rMTT), percentage signal recovery 1 (PSR 1) and PSR 2 values were calculated. The differences between the groups were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were operated.

The role of oophorectomy is yet to be established. We aimed to examine the effect of preserving the ovaries on the pattern of recurrences in patients with stage I disease. Thirty-four patients with stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma were retrospectively analysed. Based on ovarian preservation the whole cohort was divided into two groups. Recurrence (liver, lung, groin and bone) was detected in 4 (11.8%) cases. No significant differences in overall survival or disease-free survival (DFS) were observed between the ovarian preservation and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) groups. Subset analysis revealed no significant difference in DFS between the ovarian preservation and BSO groups in the premenopausal arm. And also, the performance of pelvic (n = 2) or para-aortic lymphadenectomy (n = 6) or adjuvant hormonal therapy did not alter DFS significantly. The 5-year DFS rate for the group which received adjuvant radiotherapy was 62.5 and 94.4% for those which did not (p = .014). Preserving the ovaries had no adverse effect on the recurrence of stage I disease. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Due to the rarity of the disease and the common postoperative diagnosis, only retrospective studies have been reported on low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. This disease is commonly diagnosed in premenopausal patients during the early stage. There is no consensus on preserving the ovaries, particularly in young patients, due to the tumour's hormonal characteristics and the risk of late recurrences. What do the results of this study add? Ovarian preservation had no effect on the recurrence of stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Lymphadenectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment had no effect on DFS, and adjuvant radiotherapy decreased DFS in the current study. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

PI3K-activated tumors recurred earlier than other subgroups, but had intermediate long-term outcome. Among low-grade tumors, HH and TRAF7 meningiomas exhibited elevated recurrence compared to other subgroups. Recurrence of NF2 tumors was associated with male gender, high-grade, and elevated Ki-67.

Melatonin might be able to change the pathophysiological process and prognosis into a positive way that might prevent and heal endometrial hyperplasia, which is the first stage of endometrial cancer. For this perspective, we tried to investigate the effect of melatonin on uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in an experimental rat model. Forty Wistar-Albino rats were undergone bilateral oophorectomy and randomized into four groups. To create a model of uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in all groups, except the control group [C] (n = 10), 4 mg/kg/day estradiol hemihydrate were given for 14 days. The uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia was evaluated histopathologically in the left uterine horns, then the groups were treated for 14 days as follows; melatonin (10 mg/kg/day/po) [M] (n = 10), melatonin + estradiol hemihydrate (10 mg/kg/day/po and 4 mg/kg/day/po) [M + E] (n = 10), and dark environment [D] (n = 10).

Leveraging a 3D rat primary neural organotypic in vitro model (rat brainsphere), we compare developmental neurotoxic effects of BDE-47-the most abundant PBDE congener-with four OPFR (isopropylated phenyl phosphate-IPP, triphenyl phosphate-TPHP, isodecyl diphenyl phosphate-IDDP, and tricresyl phosphate (also known as trimethyl phenyl phosphate)-TMPP). Employing mass spectroscopy-based metabolomics and transcriptomics, we observe at similar human-relevant non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.1-5 µM) stronger developmental neurotoxic effects by OPFR. This includes toxicity to neurons in the low µM range; all FR decrease the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (except BDE-47 and TPHP). Furthermore, n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), considered a neurologic diagnostic molecule, was decreased by all OPFR. At similar concentrations, the FR currently in use decreased plasma membrane dopamine active transporter expression, while BDE-47 did not. Several findings suggest astrogliosis induced by the OPFR, but not BDE-47. At the 5 µM concentrations, the OPFR more than BDE-47 interfered with myelination. An increase of cytokine gene and receptor expressions suggests that exposure to OPFR may induce an inflammatory response.

Papillary tumor of the pineal region is considered one of four pineal parenchymal tumors according to the 2007 World Health Organisation classification of central nervous system tumors. It is mostly seen in the middle age and it is rare under the age of 17 in the literature. In this report, we aim to present a case with papillary tumor of the pineal region with both CT and MRI findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis. Case report: A 17-year-old female patient who underwent a treatment of ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus 18 months ago applied to the neurosurgery clinic with nausea, vomiting, sensorineural hearing loss and Parinaud syndrome continuing through 1 month. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been applied. A 58x31x38 mm mass with cystic and mild hyperdense soft tissue components was observed in the localization of pineal gland and posterior comissure on non-enhanced CT. MRI examination revealed that the mass filled the pineal region, contained solid and large cystic components, and hyperintense on T1-weighted images. After intravenous contrast media injection, the mass enhanced more peripherally. DW-MRI showed that there is a diffusion restriction in some parts of the soft tissue components. The mass was totally resected, and pathology report revealed that it is a papillary tumor of the pineal region.

While its prognosis is generally favorable, disease recurrence is relatively frequent. Because morbidity after repeated surgery may be significant, an optimized prediction of recurrence-free survival (RFS) has the potential to improve current management strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the Ki-67 proliferation index with respect to RFS in patients with DFSP. We retrospectively analyzed data from 45 patients with DFSP. We calculated the Ki-67 proliferation index as the percentage of immunostained nuclei among the total number of tumor cell nuclei regardless of the intensity of immunostaining. We constructed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify predictors of RFS. Among the 45 patients included in the study, 8 developed local recurrences and 2 had lung metastases (median follow-up: 95.0 months; range: 5.2-412.4 months). The RFS rates at 60, 120, and 240 months of follow-up were 83.8%, 76.2%, and 65.3%, respectively. The median Ki-67 proliferation index was 14%. Notably, we identified the Ki-67 proliferation index as the only independent predictor for RFS in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio = 1.106, 95% confidence interval = 1.019-1.200, p = 0.016).

A Literature Review and Case Report.,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,"The relationship between the endocrine system and autoimmunity has been recognized for a long time and one of the best examples of autoimmune endocrine disease is autoimmune hypophysitis. A better understanding of autoimmune mechanisms and radiological, biochemical, and immunological developments have given rise to the definition of new autoimmune disorders including autoimmunity-related hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. However, whether hypothalamitis may occur as a distinct entity, is still matter of debate. Here we describe a 35-year-old woman with growing suprasellar mass, partial empty sella, central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, and hyperprolactinemia. Histopathologic examination of surgically removed suprasellar mass revealed lymphocytic infiltrate suggestive of an autoimmune disease with hypothalamic involvement. The presence of anti-hypothalamus antibodies to AVP-secreting cells (AVPcAb) at high titers and the absence of anti-pituitary antibodies suggested the diagnosis of isolated hypothalamitis. Some similar conditions have sometimes been reported in the literature but the simultaneous double finding of lymphocytic infiltrate and the presence of AVPcAb so far has never been reported. We think that the hypothalamitis can be considered a new isolated autoimmune disease affecting the hypothalamus while the lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis can be a consequence of hypothalamitis with subsequent autoimmune involvement of the pituitary. To our knowledge this is the first observation of autoimmune hypothalamic involvement with central diabetes insipidus, partial empty sella, anti-hypothalamic antibodies and hypopituitarism.",eng,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,0375362,0021-972X,aheadofprint,33104773,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,NA,NA,J Clin Endocrinol Metab

In ovarian cases, more MCs were counted overall in the necrotizing group, but there were fewer vascular structures. The increase in the number of MC and vascular structures in lungs and stomach in the non-necrotizing group supports the theory that MCs are involved in tumor progression.

INH treatment also increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activities of p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) while decreasing levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Double immunofluorescence expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in brain tissues were increased after INH administration. Furthermore, INH increased mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm), glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), NF-κB, TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GFAP in rat brain tissues. Co-treatment with CR increased anti-oxidant capacity as well as regulated inflammation and apoptosis in brain. Additionally, molecular docking results showed that CR had the potential to interact with the active sites of TNF-α and NFκ-B. In conclusion, CR improved INH-induced brain oxidative damage, inflammation and apoptosis, possibly through their antioxidant properties.",eng,Neurotoxicology,7905589,0161-813X,ppublish,33121995,10.1016/j.neuro.2020.10.009,81,NA,Neurotoxicology

Regarding these parameters, in cisplatin group NF-ƘB, MDA and TOS levels were statistically significantly increased with cisplatin administration and giving taxifolin concomitantly with cisplatin prevented this elevation. On the other hand, tGSH and TAS levels were statistically significantly decreased with cisplatin administration and routine simultaneous application of taxifolin with cisplatin prevented this decrease. In histopathological findings, haemorrhage was observed in the perineum of the injured optic nerves in the cisplatin treated group. And also edoema and degeneration in nerve fascicles in damaged optic nerves were seen in the cisplatin group. In the taxifolin treated group histopathological examinations were close to normal appearance, except mild edoema in nerve fascicles.

Investigating other specific substrates of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities may illuminate how it performs these diverse functions in mammalian cells. We report that macrophage IRE1 plays an unprecedented role in regulating phosphatidylinositide-derived signaling lipid metabolites and has profound impact on the downstream signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This cross-talk between UPR and mTOR pathways occurs through the unconventional maturation of microRNA (miR) 2137 by IRE1's RNase activity.

In addition to that, poststroke neuroregeneration is stimulated upon transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium further enhances the neuroregenerative potential of MSCs, which act by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs). The present work analyzed, whether MSC preconditioning with lithium modifies EV secretion patterns, enhancing the therapeutic potential of such derived EVs (Li-EVs) in comparison with EVs enriched from native MSCs. Indeed, Li-EVs significantly enhanced the resistance of cultured astrocytes, microglia, and neurons against hypoxic injury when compared with controls and to native EV-treated cells. Using a stroke mouse model, intravenous delivery of Li-EVs increased neurological recovery and neuroregeneration for as long as 3 months in comparison with controls and EV-treated mice, albeit the latter also showed significantly better behavioral test performance compared with controls. Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium also changed the secretion patterns for such EVs, modifying the contents of various miRNAs within these vesicles. As such, Li-EVs displayed significantly increased levels of miR-1906, which has been shown to be a new regulator of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Li-EVs reduced posthypoxic and postischemic TLR4 abundance, resulting in an inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, decreased proteasomal activity, and declined both inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, all of which culminating in reduced levels of poststroke cerebral inflammation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in termination of IL2 activation are largely unknown in human NK cells. PR/SET domain 1 was previously reported to decrease cell growth and increase apoptosis in an IL2-dependent manner in malignant NK cell lines, suggesting the possibility of down-regulation of IL2 signaling pathway gene(s) through direct transcriptional repression. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified a PRDM1 binding site on the first intron of CD25 (IL2RA), which codes for the IL2 receptor subunit regulating sensitivity to IL2 signaling, in primary NK cells activated with engineered K562 cells or IL2. Ectopic expression of PRDM1 down-regulated CD25 expression at transcript and protein levels in two PRDM1 nonexpressing NK cell lines. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD25 in two malignant NK cell lines led to progressive depletion of NK cells in low IL2 concentrations. By contrast, ectopic CD25 expression in primary human NK cells led to progressive increase in cell number in CD25-transduced cells in low IL2 concentrations. Altogether these results reveal a pivotal role of PRDM1 in inhibition of IL2-induced NK cell expansion through direct repression of CD25 in activated human NK cells. These observations provide additional support for the role of PRDM1 in attenuation of NK cell activation and growth, with implications on neoplastic transformation or NK cell function when it is deregulated.",eng,J Leukoc Biol,8405628,0741-5400,aheadofprint,33145806,10.1002/JLB.2A0520-321RR,NA,NA,J Leukoc Biol

In recent years, many studies revealed the inflammatory nature of endometriosis. Many of the immune cells and their secretory products cytokines and chemokines has been detected in body fluids of women with endometriosis. Cytokines are protein or glycoprotein in structures and hormon-like molecules that act generally in a paracrine fashion to regulate immun responses.

MSI status is assessed to detect Lynch syndrome, guide adjuvant chemotherapy, determine prognosis, and use as a companion test for checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Traditionally, MSI status is determined by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. The Idylla™ MSI Assay is a fully automated molecular method (including automated result interpretation), using seven novel MSI biomarkers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A, SULF2) and not requiring matched normal tissue. In this real-world global study, 44 clinical centers performed Idylla™ testing on a total of 1301 archived colorectal cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and compared Idylla™ results against available results from routine diagnostic testing in those sites. MSI mutations detected with the Idylla™ MSI Assay were equally distributed over the seven biomarkers, and 84.48% of the MSI-high samples had ≥ 5 mutated biomarkers, while 98.25% of the microsatellite-stable samples had zero mutated biomarkers.

Vasopressin acts primarily to reabsorb water via urinary concentration. However, fat is also a source of metabolic water, raising the possibility that vasopressin might have a role in fat accumulation. Fructose has also been reported to stimulate vasopressin. Here we tested the hypothesis that fructose induced metabolic syndrome is mediated by vasopressin. Orally administered fructose, glucose or high fructose corn syrup increased vasopressin (copeptin) concentrations and was mediated by fructokinase, an enzyme specific for fructose metabolism. Suppressing vasopressin with hydration both prevented and ameliorated fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. The vasopressin effects were mediated by the Vasopressin 1b receptor, as Vasopressin 1b receptor knockout mice were completely protected while V1a knockout paradoxically showed worse metabolic syndrome. The mechanism is likely mediated in part by de novo expression of V1b in the liver that amplifies fructokinase expression in response to fructose. Thus, our studies document a new role for vasopressin in water conservation via the accumulation of fat as a source of metabolic water. Clinically, it also suggests that increased water intake may be a beneficial way to both prevent or treat metabolic syndrome.",eng,JCI Insight,101676073,2379-3708,aheadofprint,33320834,10.1172/jci.insight.140848,NA,NA,JCI Insight

Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis.

Subsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard et al. 2015 Studies in Mycology 80: 189-245) who proposed dividing Fusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus Neocosmospora, with subsequent justification based on claims that the Geiser et al. (2013) concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic (Sandoval-Denis et al. 2018; Persoonia 41:109-129). Here we test this claim, and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as Neocosmospora were recombined in Fusarium, and nine others were renamed Fusarium. Here the global Fusarium community voices strong support for the inclusion of the FSSC in Fusarium, as it remains the best scientific, nomenclatural and practical taxonomic option available.",eng,Phytopathology,9427222,0031-949X,aheadofprint,33200960,10.1094/PHYTO-08-20-0330-LE,NA,NA,Phytopathology

Transcriptomic profiling studies have thus far revealed the presence of molecular subtypes of AML that are not accounted for by standard clinical parameters or by routinely used biomarkers. Such molecular subtypes of AML are predicted to vary in response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is an important group of proteins that play a critical role in regulating blood pressure, vascular resistance and fluid/electrolyte balance. RAS pathway genes are also known to be present locally in tissues such as the bone marrow, where they play an important role in leukemic hematopoiesis. In this study, we asked if the RAS genes could be utilized to predict drug responses in patients with AML. We show that the combined in silico analysis of up to five RAS genes can reliably predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin as well as Etoposide in AML. The same genes could also predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin when tested in vitro. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of TNF-alpha and type-I IFN response genes among sensitive, and TGF-beta and fibronectin related genes in resistant cancer cells.

For this purpose, 40 male Wistar albino rats were used. The animals were assigned to the following 4 groups: control group (received corn oil vehicle alone), diosmin-treated group (50 mg/kg bw/day orally), deltamethrin-exposed group (5 mg/kg bw/day, orally) and coadministered group (5 mg/kg bw/day deltamethrin and 50 mg/kg bw/day diosmin, orally) for 28 days. Some lipid peroxidation/antioxidant status/biochemical markers were evaluated in blood/tissue (liver, kidney, brain, heart and testis) samples and the histopathological architecture was assessed. Compared with the control group, no alteration was detected in the parameters and histological findings of the diosmin-treated group. Deltamethrin toxicity was associated with significantly increased plasma, cardiac, hepatic, renal, cerebral and testicular levels of MDA and NO, and significantly decreased GSH levels (p &lt; 0.05). Antioxidant enzyme status (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities) displayed either decrease or increase (p &lt; 0.05). Significant increase was detected in AST and ALT activities and urea and creatinine levels (p &lt; 0.05). The values of the group coadministered with deltamethrin and diosmin were similar to the values of the control group. Diosmin ameliorated deltamethrin-induced lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration and subendocardial oedema in the heart. Combined administration also minimized hepatic, renal, testicular and cerebral histopathological findings. The alterations detected in various toxicological parameters correlated well with the histopathological changes observed in various organs. In conclusion, it is suggested that diosmin could provide protection against deltamethrin-induced toxicity and organ damage in rats.",eng,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,9441769,0944-1344,aheadofprint,33242198,10.1007/s11356-020-11277-y,NA,NA,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int

Rejuveinix (RJX) is an intravenous formulation of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Its active ingredients include ascorbic acid, cyanocobalamin, thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin 5' phosphate, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and calcium D-pantothenate. RJX is being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant treatment platform for patients with sepsis, including COVID-19 patients with viral sepsis and ARDS. Here, we report its clinical safety profile in a phase 1 clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) and its potent protective activity in the lipopolysaccharide galactosamine (LPS-GalN) mouse model of ARDS. Methods: A phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-part, ascending dose-escalation study was performed in participating 76 healthy volunteer human subjects in compliance with the ICH (E6) good clinical practice guidelines to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RJX (Protocol No. RPI003; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105). The ability of RJX to prevent fatal shock, ARDS, and multi-organ failure was examined in the well-established LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Standard methods were employed for the statistical analysis of data in both studies. Findings: In the phase 1 clinical study, no participant developed serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 3-Grade 4 adverse events (AEs) or prematurely discontinued participation in the study. In the non-clinical study, RJX exhibited potent and dose-dependent protective activity, decreased the inflammatory cytokine responses (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta), and improved survival in the LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Histopathological examinations showed that RJX attenuated the LPS-GalN induced acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary edema as well as liver damage. Conclusion: RJX showed a very favorable safety profile and tolerability in human subjects.

Since oxidative stress causes pathological changes in neuronal structures antioxidant compounds gained significant attention the last decades. Although several antioxidant compounds showed neuroprotective actions in Parkinson's disease models, only a few of them demonstrated protective effects against loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons. Idebenone is an analog of the well-known antioxidant compound coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Clinical safety of idebenone is well described, and due to its high antioxidant capacity currently used to treat Freidrich's ataxia and Alzheimer's disease. Like Parkinson's disease, these diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial balance in neurons. However, knowledge about the effects of idebenone on Parkinson's disease is limited. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate and delineate the possible effects of idebenone in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease models. Idebenone (200 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the decrease of striatal expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase[quinone]-1, which is an essential element for mitochondrial respiration. Idebenone decreased the striatal levels of the lipid peroxidation products and increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx-4), which is primarily known for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, idebenone mitigated motor impairment and increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron survival. Together our results thus indicate that that idebenone has protective effects against a rotenone insult with pleiotropic actions on the cellular oxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation.",eng,Neurochem Res,7613461,0364-3190,aheadofprint,33247801,10.1007/s11064-020-03186-w,NA,NA,Neurochem Res

For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect p-value&lt; 0.05, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) assessment was used, classifying the evidence from very low to high. From 184 abstracts initially identified, 11 meta-analyses (for a total of 34 outcomes) were included. Half of the outcomes were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that stem cells are more useful than placebo. High certainty of evidence supports the associations of the use of stem cells with a better left ventricular end systolic volume and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in acute myocardial infarction; improved exercise time in refractory angina; a significant lower risk of amputation rate in critical limb ischemia; a higher successful rate in complete healing in case of lower extremities ulcer; and better values of LVEF in systolic heart failure, as compared to placebo.

Previous clinical studies on montelukast have reported conflicting results and, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies concerning these side effects had been conducted. In the current study, the effect of montelukast on depression-like behavior in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model was investigated. A total of 3 OVA challenges were applied at 2 week intervals for the persistence of asthma. Depression-like behavior was assessed using forced swim tests following each challenge and locomotor activities were evaluated using open field tests. At the end of the current study, plasma montelukast concentrations were measured and the development of asthma and effect of montelukast treatment were histopathologically examined. Inflammation scores that were increased in the OVA mice following all challenges were indicated to be reduced by montelukast treatment. The immobility time of mice increased beginning with the first challenge and this was also reduced by montelukast treatment. Montelukast administration to the control mice did not alter immobility times. Moreover, motor activity of the OVA and montelukast-treated mice were not altered. The results indicated there was no association between chronic montelukast treatment and depression. Furthermore, the chronic administration of montelukast to non-asthmatic mice did not increase immobility. However, depressive behavior increased at all time points in the OVA mice. These results indicated that chronic montelukast treatment is not associated with depression-like behavior and confirmed the association between asthma and depression.

Combined efforts from farmers, animal scientists, and veterinarians have been continuing to explore the effective disease control approaches for the production of safe animal-originated food. Implementing the immunogenomics, along with genome editing technology, has been considering as the key approach for safe food-animal production through the improvement of the host genetic resistance. Next-generation sequencing, as a cutting-edge technique, enables the production of high throughput transcriptomic and genomic profiles resulted from host-pathogen interactions. Immunogenomics combine the transcriptomic and genomic data that links to host resistance to disease, and predict the potential candidate genes and their genomic locations. Genome editing, which involves insertion, deletion, or modification of one or more genes in the DNA sequence, is advancing rapidly and may be poised to become a commercial reality faster than it has thought. The clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) [CRISPR/Cas9] system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in agricultural food production including livestock disease management. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated insertion of NRAMP1 gene for producing tuberculosis resistant cattle, and deletion of CD163 gene for producing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) resistant pigs are two groundbreaking applications of genome editing in livestock.

Treated hepatocytes with KA attenuated palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and downregulated lipogenesis-associated genes as well as ER stress markers in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, KA augmented AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) expression, and autophagy markers. The small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and ORP150, or 3-methyladenine also abrogated the effects of KA on ER stress and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In accordance with in vitro observations, KA administration to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes as well as ER stress. Moreover, KA treatment increased hepatic AMPK phosphorylation, ORP150 expression, and autophagy related markers in mouse livers. Knockdown of AMPK using in vivo transfection mitigated the effects of KA on hepatic steatosis and ER stress as well as autophagy and ORP150 expression. These results suggest that KA ameliorates hepatic steatosis via the AMPK/autophagy- and AMPK/ORP150-mediated suppression of ER stress. In sum, KA might be used as a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of NAFLD.",eng,J Cell Physiol,0050222,0021-9541,aheadofprint,33283879,10.1002/jcp.30199,NA,NA,J Cell Physiol

Numerous mutational processes leave marks on the genome in the form of mutations, copy number alterations, rearrangements or their combinations. To explore gliomagenesis, we hypothesized that gliomas with different underlying oncogenic mechanisms would have differences in the burden of various forms of these genomic alterations. This was an analysis on adult diffuse gliomas, but IDH-mutant gliomas as well as diffuse midline gliomas H3-K27M were excluded to search for the possible presence of new entities among the very heterogenous group of IDH-WT glioblastomas. The cohort was divided into two molecular subsets: (1) Molecularly-defined GBM (mGBM) as those that carried molecular features of glioblastomas (including TERT promoter mutations, 7/10 pattern, or EGFR-amplification), and (2) those who did not (others). Whole exome sequencing was performed for 37 primary tumors and matched blood samples as well as 8 recurrences. Single nucleotide variations (SNV), short insertion or deletions (indels) and copy number alterations (CNA) were quantified using 5 quantitative metrics (SNV burden, indel burden, copy number alteration frequency-wGII, chromosomal arm event ratio-CAER, copy number amplitude) as well as 4 parameters that explored underlying oncogenic mechanisms (chromothripsis, double minutes, microsatellite instability and mutational signatures). Findings were validated in the TCGA pan-glioma cohort. mGBM and &quot;Others&quot; differed significantly in their SNV (only in the TCGA cohort) and CNA metrics but not indel burden. SNV burden increased with increasing age at diagnosis and at recurrences and was driven by mismatch repair deficiency.

The neuroprotective cargo of EVs, however, has not yet been identified. To investigate such cargo and its underlying mechanism, primary neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) and cocultured with adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) or ADMSC-secreted EVs. Under such conditions, both ADMSCs and ADMSC-secreted EVs significantly reduced neuronal death. Screening for signalling cascades being involved in the interaction between ADMSCs and neurons revealed a decreased autophagic flux as well as a declined p53-BNIP3 activity in neurons receiving either treatment paradigm. However, the aforementioned effects were reversed when ADMSCs were pretreated with the inhibitor of exosomal secretion GW4869 or when Hrs was knocked down. In light of miR-25-3p being the most highly expressed miRNA in ADMSC-EVs interacting with the p53 pathway, further in vitro work focused on this pathway. Indeed, a miR-25-3p oligonucleotide mimic reduced cell death, whereas the anti-oligonucleotide increased autophagic flux and cell death by modulating p53-BNIP3 signalling in primary neurons exposed to OGD. Likewise, native ADMSC-EVs but not EVs obtained from ADMSCs pretreated with the anti-miR-25-3p oligonucleotide (ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p) confirmed the aforementioned in vitro observations in C57BL/6 mice exposed to cerebral ischemia. The infarct size was reduced, and neurological recovery was increased in mice treated with native ADMSC-EVs when compared to ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p. ADMSCs induce neuroprotection by improved autophagic flux through secreted EVs containing miR-25-3p. Hence, our work uncovers a novel key factor in naturally secreted ADMSC-EVs for the regulation of autophagy and induction of neuroprotection in a preclinical stroke model.",eng,J Extracell Vesicles,101610479,2001-3078,ppublish,33304476,10.1002/jev2.12024,10,1,J Extracell Vesicles

Most of the studies investigating PD-L1 expression in endometrial carcinoma have used tissue microarrays and did not examine all tumor blocks. In this study, we analyzed the expression of PD-L1 in resection specimens of 176 consecutive endometrial carcinomas using all tumor blocks; we compared PD-L1 expression in MMR-deficient endometrial carcinomas, including the MLH1 and PMS2-loss subgroup, and the other MMR-loss subgroups (MSH2 and MSH6, isolated PMS2, and isolated MSH6), with the MMR-intact subgroup. MLH1 methylation was performed in tumors with MLH1 and PMS2 loss. Tumor cell (TC) and tumor-associated immune cell (IC) PD-L1 positivity with a 1% cutoff was observed in 21% (n=37) and 66.5% (n=117) of cases, respectively, and with a 5% cutoff in 5.1% (n=9) and 39.8% (n=70) of cases, respectively. MMR protein deficiency was a statistically significant parameter associated with IC PD-L1 positivity, with 1% and 5% cutoffs on multivariate analysis [odds ratio (OR)=5.236, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.075-13.211, P=0.001, and OR=3.702, 95% CI=1.759-7.791, P=0.001, respectively].

Analysis revealed that genes associated with cancer stem cells, such as POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG, BMI1, BMP2, CD44, SOX9, and ALDH1 were markedly upregulated in enzalutamide resistant cells. Amongst the pathways enriched in the enzalutamide-resistant cells were those associated with RUNX2, hedgehog, integrin signaling, and molecules associated with elastic fibers. Further examination of a patient cohort undergoing ADT and its comparison with no-ADT group demonstrated high expression of POU5F1 (OCT4), ALDH1, and SOX2 in ADT specimens, suggesting that they may be clinically relevant therapeutic targets. Altogether, our approach exhibits the potential of integrative transcriptomic analyses to identify critical genes and pathways of antiandrogen resistance as a promising approach for designing novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent drug resistance.",eng,Int J Mol Sci,101092791,1422-0067,epublish,33339129,10.3390/ijms21249568,21,24,Int J Mol Sci

The prevalence of CE depends upon human behavioral risk factors, the diversity and ecology of animal host interactions and the genetic diversity within Echinococcus species which differ in their zoonotic potential and pathogenicity. It is a neglected, economic and socio-cultural problem in Pakistan. The available data about the incidence of CE is very limited and no extensive study has been reported in Pakistan.

All children had normal growth and no sign of chondrodysplasia at birth and prior to their primary disease. After HSCT, all children developed growth failure, with standard deviation scores for height at or below -3. Radiographically, all children had changes in the spine, metaphyses and epiphyses, compatible with a spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. Genomic sequencing failed to detect pathogenic variants in genes associated with osteochondrodysplasias.

In this way, 30 min after rats were given 25 and 50 mg/kg/b.w CHR orally for seven consecutive days, 30 mg/kg/b.w PbAc was administered orally. In biochemical analysis of testicular tissue, it was found that PbAc-reduced antioxidant parameters [glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)], while it increased lipid peroxidation, inflammatory markers [nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)], and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In the immunohistochemical examination, it was determined that PbAc increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3. Accordingly, PbAc was found to cause a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in the percentage of dead sperm. However, it has been observed that CHR relieves oxidative stress due to its antioxidant properties, thus protecting against inflammation and apoptosis. It also allowed the CHR sperm parameters to return to control group levels. The results revealed that CHR could be a natural substance to be used in Pb-induced testicular toxicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lead (Pb) is an important environmental contaminant heavy metal. Pb is believed to reduce fertility in men. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the damage caused by Pb to testicular tissue. CHR is an antioxidant substance that occurs naturally in various plants and has various pharmacological properties. In the present study, it was investigated whether CHR has a protective effect against testicular toxicity induced by PbAc. The results revealed that in rats, CHR protects the testicular tissue from PbAc toxicity by showing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, thus bringing sperm parameters closer to normal.",eng,J Food Biochem,7706045,0145-8884,aheadofprint,33368351,10.1111/jfbc.13593,NA,NA,J Food Biochem

Survival analyses were performed in a novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable mouse model of PCa under adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine+/-physostigmine/pyridostigmine (n = 30 mice).

Inhibition of this cancer-cell-intrinsic AChE via pyridostigmine and physostigmine, or administration of acetylcholine (ACh), diminished PCa cell viability and invasion in vitro and in vivo via suppression of pERK signaling, and reduced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable PCa mouse model, adjuvant co-therapy with AChE blockers had no impact on survival. Accordingly, survival of resected PCa patients did not differ based on tumor AChE expression levels.

In recent years, nuclear imaging methods have gained importance in the diagnosis of IE. The present study aims to investigate the imaging potential of 99mTc-labeled vancomycin ( 99mTc-Vancomycin) as a new agent that would enable the diagnosis of IE in its early stages when it is difficult to diagnose or has small vegetation, in the experimental rat model.

Patient-related factors determining the outcome in SM are largely unknown. Methods: We examined the impact of sex on the clinical features, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in 3403 patients with mastocytosis collected in the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM). The impact of cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations on sex differences was analyzed in a subset of patients. Results: Of all patients enrolled, 55.3% were females. However, a male predominance was found in a subset of advanced SM (AdvSM) patients, namely SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN, 70%; p &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, organomegaly (male: 23% vs. female: 13%, p = 0.007) was more, whereas skin involvement (male: 71% vs. female: 86%, p = 0.001) was less frequent in males. In all patients together, OS (p &lt; 0.0001) was significantly inferior in males, and also within the WHO sub-categories indolent SM, aggressive SM (ASM) and SM-AHN. PFS was significantly (p = 0.0002) worse in males when all patients were grouped together; due to low numbers of events, this significance persisted only in the subcategory smoldering SM.

Somatostatin analogue (SSA)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) have been used in clinical trials and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Focus 3 performed a multidisciplinary Delphi process to deliver a balanced perspective on molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). NETs form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones. These cells, called neuroendocrine cells, can be found throughout the body, but NETs are most often found in the abdomen, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. These tumours may also be found in the lungs, pancreas and adrenal glands. In addition to being rare, NETs are also complex and may be difficult to diagnose. Most NETs are non-functioning; however, a minority present with symptoms related to hypersecretion of bioactive compounds. NETs often do not cause symptoms early in the disease process. When diagnosed, substantial number of patients are already found to have metastatic disease. Several societies' guidelines address Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) management; however, many issues are still debated, due to both the difficulty in acquiring strong clinical evidence in a rare and heterogeneous disease and the different availability of diagnostic and therapeutic options across countries. EANM Focus 3 reached consensus on employing 68gallium-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA)-based PET/CT with diagnostic CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for unknown primary NET detection, metastatic NET, NET staging/restaging, suspected extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and suspected paraganglioma. Consensus was reached on employing 18fluorine-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/CT in neuroendocrine carcinoma, G3 NET and in G1-2 NET with mismatched lesions (CT-positive/[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA-negative). Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was recommended for second line treatment for gastrointestinal NET with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA uptake in all lesions, in G1/G2 NET at disease progression, and in a subset of G3 NET provided all lesions are positive at [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA.

Some PTCs with classical papillae can be totally or partially encapsulated, and these tumors are called &quot;encapsulated&quot; (conventional) variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of this variant, comparing with non-encapsulated conventional type PTC. Among 823 thyroidectomy specimens with PTC diagnosed between 2015 and 2018, 121 tumors from 105 patients (12.75%) were reclassified as encapsulated conventional PTC. In 76 patients, tumors were unifocal. Size, cystic changes, background thyroiditis, psammoma bodies, cervical lymph node metastasis at presentation, capsular/vascular invasion, and immunohistochemical BRAF-V600E expression were evaluated. Ninety-two non-encapsulated conventional PTCs served as control group. Encapsulated cases were predominantly women (73.3%), 56.4% were microcarcinomas, 97.5% had cystic changes, 81.4% were BRAF-V600E positive, and 36.8% of unifocal encapsulated tumors had cervical lymph node metastasis. Thyroiditis and psammoma bodies were detected in nearly half of the encapsulated PTCs. Fourteen percent of the unifocal tumors showed total encapsulation, whereas capsular and vascular invasion was detected in 85.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Encapsulated cases did not show any significant difference from the control group, except for prominent cystic changes (p &lt; 0.001). Relationship between lymph node metastasis at presentation and capsular invasion was statistically significant (p = 0.001), and metastasis was more frequent in cases with extensive capsular invasion (no/minimal invasion versus extensive invasion, p &lt; 0.001). Cystic changes are very common, and this feature deserves mentioning as a morphological characteristic of encapsulated conventional PTCs.

The hypoxic condition is a consequence of an imbalance between rapidly proliferating cells and a vascularization that leads to lower oxygen levels in tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an essential transcription factor contributing to the regulation of hypoxia-associated genes. Some of these genes modulate molecular cascades associated with the Warburg effect and its accompanying pathways and, therefore, represent promising targets for cancer treatment. Current progress in the development of therapeutic approaches brings several promising inhibitors of HIF-1. Flavonoids, widely occurring in various plants, exert a broad spectrum of beneficial effects on human health, and are potentially powerful therapeutic tools against cancer. Recent evidences identified numerous natural flavonoids and their derivatives as inhibitors of HIF-1, associated with the regulation of critical glycolytic components in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase II (HKII), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we discuss the results of most recent studies evaluating the impact of flavonoids on HIF-1 accompanied by the regulation of critical enzymes contributing to the Warburg phenotype.

Recently, studies have demonstrated substantial variation between countries in terms of their approach to sampling gallbladders, and furthermore, that pathologists from different continents apply highly variable criteria in determining stage of invasion in this organ. These findings raised the question of whether these variations in pathologic evaluation could account for the vastly different survival rates of T2 GBC reported in the literature. In this study, survival of 316 GBCs from three countries (Chile n = 137, South Korea n = 105, USA n = 74), all adequately sampled (with a minimum of five tumor sections examined) and histopathologically verified as pT2 (after consensus examination by expert pathologists from three continents), was analyzed. Chilean patients had a significantly worse prognosis based on 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.83, p = 0.002) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.51-3.84, p &lt; 0.001), compared to their South Korean counterparts, even when controlled for age and sex. Comparing the USA to South Korea, the survival differences in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75, p = 0.015) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.14-3.31, p = 0.015) were also pronounced.

In conclusion, the survival of true T2 GBC in properly classified cases is neither as good nor as bad as previously documented in the literature and shows notable geographic differences even in well-sampled cases with consensus histopathologic criteria.

However, CCSST has been noted to have atypical histopathological features, such as epidermotropism, myxoid differentiation and presentation at atypical sites. Here, we present the first reported case of eccrine ductal differentiation in CCSST. The patient, a 21-year-old woman, presented with a lump of 10-year duration sized 3x5 cm on the plantar surface of the fourth and fifth interdigital spaces. There was an increase in size as well as pain and redness over 6 years. Besides the characteristic findings, there were ductal structures in continuity with the upper dermis indicative of ductal differentiation. The tumor stained positively with S100, HMB45 and succinic dehydrogenase; ducts stained positively with EMA and CEA. CCSST was confirmed with cytogenetic analysis showing the translocation associated with EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene.

This leads to an accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in many tissues, which results in progressive damage to the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. We present the molecular and clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of FD patients from a multidisciplinary clinic at the University of California, Irvine treated with agalsidase beta enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for 2-20 years. This cohort comprised 24 adults (11 males, 13 females) and two male children (median age 45; range 10-68 years). Of the 26 patients in this cohort, 20 were on ERT (12 males, 8 females). We describe one novel variant not previously reported in the literature in a patient with features of 'classic' FD. The vast majority of patients in this cohort presented with symptoms of 'classic' FD including peripheral neuropathic pain, some form of cardiac involvement, angiokeratomas, corneal verticillata, hypohidrosis, tinnitus, and gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily abdominal pain. The majority of males had clinically evident renal involvement. An annual eGFR reduction of -1.88 mL/min/1.73 m2/yr during the course of ERT was seen in this cohort. The most common renal presentation was proteinuria, and one individual required a renal transplant. Other common findings were pulmonary involvement, lymphedema, hearing loss, and significantly, three patients had strokes. Notably, there was a high prevalence of endocrine dysfunction and low bone mineral density, including several with osteoporosis. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) cleared plasma GL-3 in this cohort, there was limited improvement in renal function or health-related quality of life based on the patient-reported SF-36 Health Survey. Physical functioning significantly declined over the course of ERT treatment, which may be, in part, due to the late initiation of ERT in several patients.

We mimicked the human RAPs in a mouse model and found that three or more episodes of AP cause early chronic-like morphological changes in the pancreas. We concluded that three or more attacks of AP with no morphological changes to the pancreas could be considered as early CP (ECP).The new diagnostic criteria for ECP allow the majority of CP patients to be diagnosed earlier.

Thus, SEC patients may benefit from targeted treatments used in HGSOC, e.g., PARP inhibitors. However, the preclinical and clinical knowledge about SEC is scarce, and the exact role of defective DNA repair in this tumor subgroup is largely unknown. We aimed to outline the prevalence of homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), copy-number alterations, and somatic mutations in SEC. OncoScan SNP arrays were applied to 19 tumors in a consecutive SEC series to calculate HRD scores and explore global copy-number profiles and genomic aberrations. Copy-number signatures were established and targeted sequencing of 27 HRD-associated genes was performed. All factors were examined in relation to HRD scores to investigate potential drivers of the HRD phenotype. Ten of the 19 SEC tumors (53%) had an HRD score &gt; 42, considered to reflect an HRD phenotype. Higher HRD score was associated with loss of heterozygosity in key HRD genes, and copy-number signatures associated with non-BRCA1/2 dependent HRD in HGSOC. A high number of SECs display an HRD phenotype. It remains to be elucidated whether this also confers PARP inhibitor sensitivity.",eng,Cancers (Basel),101526829,2072-6694,epublish,33445465,10.3390/cancers13020254,13,2,Cancers (Basel)

One of the reasons for the failure of BC treatment is reportedly the ineffectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs). HER2 receptors have an important role in the self-renewal of BCSCs. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cytokine levels were found to be higher in BCSCs, which demonstrates their potential metastatic capacity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of BCSCs to trastuzumab and to investigate the MMP levels in primary breast cancer cells and HER2+ BCSCs. Tumour tissue samples were obtained during surgical intervention from ten breast cancer patients, and primary culture cells were established from these tissues. Four major molecular subgroups were sorted from the primary culture: HER2+ BCSCs (CD44+CD24-HER2+), HER2- BCSCs (CD44+CD24-HER2-), HER2- primary culture cells (CD44+CD24+HER2-) and triple positive primary culture cells (CD44+CD24+HER2+). These cells were cultured and treated with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and the combination of those three drugs for 96 h. Cellular responses to these drugs were determined by XTT cytotoxicity test. MMPs and cytokine array analysis showed that MMPs and TIMP-1, TIMP-2 proteins were expressed more in HER2+ BCSCs than in primary culture. HER2- BCSCs were more resistant to drugs than HER2+ BCSCs. Our findings suggest that the presence of HER2- BCSCs may be responsible for primary trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ BC cell population. Further studies investigating the function of MMPs are needed for drug targeting of BCSCs.",eng,Clin Exp Med,100973405,1591-8890,aheadofprint,33471244,10.1007/s10238-021-00685-0,NA,NA,Clin Exp Med

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide.

None had been diagnosed with, or evaluated for, pancreatobiliary maljunction, but on retrospective analysis of radiologic images, 12/66 were found to have pancreatobiliary maljunction. The clinical findings were: F/M=5.7; mean age, 48; most (77%) presented with abdominal pain; mean size, 2.9 cm; choledocholithiasis 11%. Gross/histologic examination revealed 3 distinct pathology-based categories: (I) Cystic dilatation of native ducts (81%).

Finally, we revealed that ENST00000389093 and ENST00000568883 possess pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity and may have functional roles in metabolism, cell invasion, and hypoxia response in cancer cells. Our study provided a potential explanation to the controversial prognostic indication of PKM, and could invoke future studies focusing on revealing the biological and oncological roles of these alternative spliced variants of PKM.",eng,Cancers (Basel),101526829,2072-6694,epublish,33478099,10.3390/cancers13020348,13,2,Cancers (Basel)

Label=""PATIENTS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Patients with an unfavorable CUP diagnosis, as defined by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and available cancer tissue for molecular sequencing are generally eligible. Potential CUP patients entering screening undergo a review involving reference histopathology and clinical work-up by a central Eligibility Review team (ERT). Patients with &quot;favorable&quot; CUP, a strongly suspected primary site of origin, lack of tissue, or unmet inclusion criteria are excluded.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":As of April 30, 2020, 628 patients had entered screening and 346 (55.1%) were screen failed. Screen fails were due to technical reasons (N=89), failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria not directly related to CUP diagnosis (N=89) and other reasons (N=33). 124 (35.8%) patients were excluded because unfavorable adeno- or poorly differentiated CUP could not be confirmed by the ERT. These cases were classified into 3 groups ineligible due to (i) histologic subtype, such as squamous and neuroendocrine, or favorable CUP; (ii) evidence of a possible primary tumor or (iii) non-carcinoma histology.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Experience with CUPISCO has highlighted challenges with standardized screening in an international clinical trial and the difficulties in diagnosing unfavorable CUP. Re-confirmation of unfavorable CUP by an ERT in a clinical trial can result in many reasons for screen failures.

Although they have positive effects on the treatment of various disease states; long-term administration is associated with high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. The heart attempts to cope with increased blood pressure and a decrease in glucose utilization by developing pathological cardiac remodeling. However, in this process, cardiac fibrosis formation and deterioration in heart structure and functions occur. Galectin-3, a member of the β-galactoside binding lectins, is consistently associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the pathogenesis of various disease states including insulin resistance and heart failure. Galectin-3 expression is markedly increased in activated macrophages and a subset of activated fibroblasts and vascular cells. Also, failing and remodeling myocardium show increased Gal-3 expression and elevated Gal-3 levels are related to heart failure severity and prognosis. Furthermore, Gal-3-related pathways are recently suggested as therapeutic targets both pharmacologically and genetically to increase insulin sensitivity in vivo. The objective of this review is to provide a summary of our current understanding of the role of glucocorticoid-associated insulin resistance, which is important for some cardiac events, and the potential role of galectin in this pathophysiological process.",eng,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,9717231,1095-6670,aheadofprint,33484019,10.1002/jbt.22717,NA,NA,J Biochem Mol Toxicol

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has been known to be a risk factor for the development of more severe form of saphenous vein graft disease after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We aimed to evaluate the impact of type II-DM on histopathological features of great saphenous vein grafts of patients undergoing CABG PATIENTS AND METHODS: . Forty consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG were enrolled into the study. Patients were grouped into two; Diabetic group (n=20); includes patients with preoperative diagnosis of type II-DM and Non-diabetic group (n=20): those without type II-DM. In all patients, a short segment of the great saphenous vein graft at the level of medial malleolus was taken for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evaluation. Moreover, immunoexpressions of Caveolin-1, Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were studied RESULTS: . There were no differences in the demographics of patients between two groups. The magnitude of intimal fibrosis in diabetic group was slightly higher than in non-diabetics (1.95±0.99 versus 1.3±0.8, p=0.04). In TEM, vacuolization in endothelial cells, substance accumulation along with coarse collagen fibers and cytoplasmic degeneration with vacuolization in muscle cells were detected in diabetic group. While there were no differences in Caveolin-1 and VCAM-1 immunostaining, the intensity of positive eNOS immunostaining was significantly higher in endothelium (2.10±0.64 versus 1.55±0.68, p=0.01) and tunica media 1.75±0.63 versus 1.2±0.52, p= 0.007) in non-diabetic group, respectively) compared with diabetic group CONCLUSION: .

We aimed to determine the miRNA profile in mice applied to two different CR protocols; chronic (CCR) and intermittent (ICR) and follow the MT development. In addition, the roles of miRNAs involved in adiponectin and/or leptin signaling pathways were investigated. Mice were enrolled into ad-libitum (AL), CCR, or ICR which was three-weeks AL feeding followed by one-week of 60% CR in cyclic manner. Blood and tissue collection were performed at weeks 10, 17/18, 49/50 and 81/82. Long-term CCR provided better protection compared to ICR for MT development with a delay in the MT occurrence. Adiponectin expression in mammary fat pad were significantly higher in CCR group compared to AL.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of α-lipoic acid (ALA) treatment on the anti-inflammatory activity of indomethacin (Indo) as well as the possible therapeutic effect of ALA on high dose Indo-induced gastropathy in female mice. Mice were treated with Indo (5 or 30 mg/kg, p.o) alone or in combination with ALA (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg, i.p). in vivo anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by formalin-induced paw edema measured as paw thickness and edema. Gastric damage was evaluated macroscopically and histologically by scoring mucosal hemorrhage, erosion, edema and inflammation. To our results, Indo was ineffective at 5 mg/kg, but co-treatment with Indo and ALA significantly reduced paw edema, implying that ALA augmented the anti-inflammatory effect of subtherapeutic dose of Indo. However, ALA was not able to induce a further increase in the anti-inflammatory effect of Indo at 30 mg/kg. Unlike the treatment with Indo at 5 mg/kg, Indo at 30 mg/kg caused severe gastric damage that prevented by co-treatment with ALA. These results suggest that combination of ALA with NSAIDs can both increase anti-inflammatory effect and prevent NSAIDs-induced gastric damage.

Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GH and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10 min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40 min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs.

Multilevel analysis was performed to identify patient- and tooth/site-related predictors for the 12-month MRC outcomes. Postoperative patient morbidity and histological characteristics of palatal graft samples obtained during harvesting were investigated.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":At the 12-month follow-up, MRC was 91.72±16.59% and 84.72±19.72% in DGG+TUN and SCTG+TUN groups (P=0.001). Multilevel regression analysis identified RD, KTH, and GT as variables associated with MRC. No significant difference between the groups was observed regarding postoperative patient morbidity parameters. Cellularity was found significantly higher in the SCTG samples compared to the DGG samples (P&lt;0.05).

On the other hand, patient- and tooth/site-related prognostic indicators may have a critical role in obtaining the treatment outcomes.                 Label=""PRINCIPAL FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":DGG combined with TUN showed higher mean root coverage (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) compared to SCTG in the treatment of MAGRs. Nevertheless, tooth/site related prognostic factors could impact root coverage outcomes regardless of CTG harvesting technique. Both procedures showed similar outcomes in terms of patient's postoperative morbidity and aesthetic evaluation at the 1-year follow-up.

The majority of these transcripts are uniquely expressed in differentiated tissues or specific glioma types. Pediatric oligodendroglioma (POG) is a rare subtype of diffuse glioma and accounts for &lt;1% of pediatric brain tumors. Because histologically POG resembles adult OG, the same treatment is applied as adults. However, the significance in predicting outcomes in POG patients is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of expression -profiles of microRNA (miRNA) and long noncoding RNA -(LncRNA) in POGs.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We investigated the levels of 13 known miRNAs and 6 LncRNAs in tumor samples from 9 patients with primary POG by using RT-PCR and analyzed their association with outcomes.

This comprehensive global population study elucidated the historical migration pathways of the pathogen to reveal the Eurasian origin of the fungus. When over 3800 isolates were examined, three major population clusters were revealed: North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, with distinct subclusters in the highly diverse Eastern European cluster. Modeling of historical scenarios using approximate Bayesian computation revealed the North American cluster was derived from an ancestral population in Eurasia. The Northeastern European subcluster was shown to be ancestral to all other European clusters and subclusters. The Turkish subcluster diverged first, followed by the Central European subcluster, then the Western European cluster, which has subsequently spread to much of the Southern Hemisphere. All clusters and subclusters contained both mating-types of the fungus, indicating the potential for sexual reproduction, although asexual reproduction remained the primary mode of reproduction.

In this study, MOF-embedded electrospun fiber scaffold for the controlled release of BMP-6 was developed for the first time, to enrich bone regeneration efficacy. The scaffolds were achieved by first, one-pot rapid crystallization of BMP-6 encapsulated ZIF-8 nanocrystals-as a novel carrier for growth factor molecules- and then electrospinning of the blending solution composed of poly (ε-caprolactone) and BMP-6 encapsulated ZIF-8 nanocrystals. BMP-6 molecule encapsulation efficiency for ZIF-8 nanocrystals was calculated as 98%. The in-vitro studies showed that, the bioactivity of BMP-6 was preserved and the release lasted up to 30 days. The release kinetics fitted the Korsmeyer-Peppas model exhibiting a pseudo-Fickian behavior. The in-vitro osteogenesis studies revealed the superior effect of sustained release of BMP-6 towards osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. In-vivo studies also revealed that the sustained slow release of BMP-6 was responsible for the generation of well-mineralized, new bone formation in a rat cranial defect.

Deficiencies in vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) proteins, key regulators of trafficking, cause abnormal intracellular segregation of macromolecules and organelles and are linked to human disease. VPS proteins function as part of complexes such as the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, composed of VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39 and VPS41. The HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 has been reported to promote viability of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease but to date has not been linked to human disease. Here, we describe five unrelated families with nine affected individuals, all carrying homozygous variants in VPS41 that we show impact protein function. All affected individuals presented with a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of cognitive impairment, cerebellar atrophy/hypoplasia, motor dysfunction with ataxia and dystonia, and nystagmus. Zebrafish disease modelling supports the involvement of VPS41 dysfunction in the disorder, indicating lysosomal dysregulation throughout the brain and providing support for cerebellar and microglial abnormalities when vps41 was mutated.

Changes in the amount and chemical structure of phospholipids, proteins, and lipids were investigated in the blood and serum samples of the animals using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. To evaluate biological events associated with the wound repair process in inflammatory phase we used oxidant and antioxidant status to determine the healing status of wounds such as Total antioxidant status (TAS), Total oxidant level (TOS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels. TOS level increased in DM groups and decreased in the AV and HPO group. Oxidative stress index decreased and TNF-α level increased in the HPO group. FTIR spectra showed changes in the phospholipids, proteins, and carbon chain of lipids in the whole blood as well as serum of DM rats. FTIR spectra combined with Principal component analysis (PCA) showed, that treated DM rats by AV and HPO caused return chemical structure of blood and serum to this observed in control group.

The aim of this study was to scrutinize the utility of three immunohistochemical markers including Forkhead box protein 2 (FOXL2), SOX9, and β-catenin and DICER1 mutation status in distinguishing SCTATs from other ovarian SCSTs. Nine cases of SCTAT, 10 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SCLT), 10 adult-type granulosa cell tumor (AGCT), and 8 juvenile-type granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) were included in the study. SCTATs were characterized by diffuse and strong expression of SOX9, focal and weak expression of FOXL2, and the absence of DICER1 mutation. However, AGCTs and JGCTs displayed strong and diffuse expression of FOXL2, focal/no immunoreaction for SOX9. SLCTs generally showed moderate intensity of FOXL2 and SOX9 expression. Nuclear β-catenin expression was observed in none of SLCT, 1/9 of SCTAT, 6/8 JGCT, and 4/10 AGCT cases, respectively. DICER1 hotspot mutation was detected in only 3 cases of SLCT and 2 cases of JGCT. We conclude that in addition to strong and diffuse SOX9 expression, weak/absent expression of FOXL2 is suggestive for the diagnosis of SCTAT. Hence, we suggest that inclusion of these two markers, SOX-9 and FOXL2, to the immunohistochemical panel helps in differentiation of SCTAT from other SCSTs in addition to morphologic findings.

This retrospective case-control study has been conducted on a cohort of patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy between 2015 and 2017 due to complex injury treatment. The outcomes were assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES), the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Score, need for non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumption and the visual analog scale (VAS). Complications and changes in smoking status were also noted. A cohort of 59 patients underwent shoulder arthroscopy, due to complex LHBT pathology and RCTs, and were enrolled in the final follow-up examination; with mean duration of 26.03 months. According to smoking status, 27 of patients were classified as smokers, and the remaining 32 were non-smokers. In the examined cohort, 36 patients underwent the LHBT tenotomy and 23 tenodesis. We observed a relationship between smoking status and distribution of various RCTs (p &lt; 0.0001).

There were no statistically significant differences in pre/postoperative ASES and postoperative UCLA scores between smokers and non-smokers (p &gt; 0.05). The VAS was significantly lower in the non-smokers' group (p = 0.0021). Multi-tendon injuries of the shoulder are a serious challenge for surgeons, and to obtain an excellent functional outcome, we need to limit the negative risk factors, including smoking. Furthermore, there is a significant association between smoking and the occurrence of massive rotator cuff tears, and the pain level measured by the VAS. Simultaneous surgical treatment of RC and LHBT lesions in the smoker population allowed us to obtain the functional outcomes approximated to non-smokers in the long-term follow-up.

Angiogenesis is important for mesothelioma progression, but so far, anti-angiogenic agents have not improved patient survival. Our hypothesis is that better understanding of the regulation of angiogenesis in this tumor would largely improve the success of such a therapy. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that acts as a co-receptor in various cellular processes including angiogenesis. In MM, the expression of SDC-1 is generally low but when present, SDC-1 associates to epithelioid differentiation, inhibition of tumor cell migration and favorable prognosis, meanwhile SDC-1 decrease deteriorates the prognosis. In the present study, we studied the effect of SDC-1 overexpression and silencing on MM cells ability to secrete angiogenic factors and monitored the downstream effect of SDC-1 modulation on endothelial cells proliferation, wound healing, and tube formation. This was done by adding conditioned medium from SDC-1 transfected and SDC-1 silenced mesothelioma cells to endothelial cells. Moreover, we investigated the interplay and molecular functional changes in angiogenesis in a co-culture system and characterized the soluble angiogenesis-related factors secreted to the conditioned media. We demonstrated that SDC-1 over-expression inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, and tube formation of endothelial cells. This effect was mediated by a multitude of angiogenic factors comprising angiopoietin-1 (Fold change ± SD: 0.65 ± 0.07), FGF-4 (1.45 ± 0.04), HGF (1.33 ± 0.07), NRG1-β1 (1.35 ± 0.08), TSP-1 (0.8 ± 0.02), TIMP-1 (0.89 ± 0.01) and TGF-β1 (1.35 ± 0.01). SDC-1 silencing increased IL8 (1.33 ± 0.06), promoted wound closure, but did not influence the tube formation of endothelial cells. Pleural effusions from mesothelioma patients showed that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels correlate to soluble SDC-1 levels and have prognostic value. In conclusion, SDC-1 over-expression affects the angiogenic factor secretion of mesothelioma cells and thereby inhibits endothelial cells proliferation, tube formation, and wound healing.

Acquired EV develops in immunocompromised patients such as HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Patients with a prior history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have tendency to develop generalized verrucosis. We report an extraordinary case of disseminated epidermodysplasia verruciformis seen in a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome who had undergone HSCT. He had plane, brown papules involving his face, forearms, neck, anterior chest, nape, back, and knees.

Capmatinib (CAP), a novel mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition inhibitor, is reported to attenuate pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress. In this study, the effects of CAP on lipogenesis in the adipocytes were examined. Treatment with CAP dose-dependently suppressed lipid accumulation in, and differentiation of, and increased lipolysis in, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, CAP treatment augmented adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and FNDC5 expression in the adipocytes. Transfection with si-AMPK or si-FNDC5 mitigated the CAP-induced suppression of lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis.

Label=""PRESENTATION OF CASE"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 36-year-old woman was admitted with extensive surgical site inflammation after a caesarean section. Despite antibiotic treatment and wound care, the clinical course deteriorated rapidly. Wound debridement following negative pressure closure was performed due to an immediate increase in skin necrosis. A diagnosis of PG was reached based on the absence of a positive wound culture, resistance to wound debridement and the histopathological results. A course of high-dose corticosteroids was started, and a successful clinical course was finally achieved. The patient is now in the 14th month of remission, with no recurrence.

Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19. Although not clinically investigated yet, the applicability of flavonoids against COVID-19 could be a promising strategy due to a broad spectrum of their biological activities.",eng,Biomed Pharmacother,8213295,0753-3322,aheadofprint,33662680,10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111430,138,NA,Biomed Pharmacother

When the tourniquet is released, reperfusion injury occurs with the resumption of blood flow. Molecular hydrogen can easily attach to biomembranes and enter cytosol, mitochondria and other organelles of the cell and convert the formed OH- to H₂O to prevent cell and tissue damage.

Label=""STUDY DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Thirty-six Wistar-albino male rats were randomly divided into six groups. No operations were performed in the Sham group. Ventral penile Mathieu type flap was prepared and Pt was applied to the root of the penis with a plastic band in other groups. Pt was applied 10 and 30 min in the PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. HRSS was injected intraperitoneally (ip) 5 ml/kg just before Pt was released in the HRSS1⁰ and HRSS³⁰ groups. In the HRSSB group, HRSS was injected 1 h before 10 min of Pt application. At the 4th hour of experiments the rats were sacrificed and tissue samples were taken for biochemical and histopathological studies. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were determined in the penile tissue. The results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Pearson's Chi-Squared test.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Tissue MDA, MPO, IL-6 and TNF-α values were significantly lower in all HRSS groups compared to PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. Tissue GSH levels of HRSS groups were higher compared to PT groups. Histopathologically, inflammation was found to be higher in PT groups compared to HRSS groups. Interestingly, in the HRSSB group with HRSS administration prior to Pt, the damage was less in grade, but not statistically different than the other HRSS groups (p &gt; 0.05).

A significant proportion of cases presents as clinically and grossly inapparent lesions, and grossing protocols are not well established. Among epithelial alterations, pseudo-pyloric gland metaplasia is ubiquitous and of no apparent consequence, whereas goblet cell metaplasia and a foveolar change in surface cells require closer attention. Low-grade dysplasia is difficult to objectively define and appears to be clinically inconsequential by itself; however, extra sampling is required to exclude the possibility of accompanying more significant lesions. For high-grade dysplasia (&quot;high-grade BilIN&quot; a.k.a. &quot;carcinoma in-situ&quot;), a complete sampling is necessary to rule out invasion. Designating in-situ or minimally invasive carcinomas limited to muscularis or above as early gallbladder carcinoma (EGBC) helps alleviate the major geographic differences (West/East) in the criteria for &quot;invasiveness&quot; to assign a case to pTis or pT1. Total sampling is crucial in proper diagnosis of such cases. A subset of invasive GBCs (5-10%) arise from the intracholecystic neoplasm (ICN, &quot;adenoma-carcinoma sequence&quot;) category. About 2/3rds of ICNs have invasive carcinoma. However, this propensity differ by subtype. True &quot;pyloric gland adenomas&quot; (&gt; 1 cm) are uncommon and scarcely associated with invasive carcinoma. A distinct subtype of ICN composed of tubular, non-mucinous MUC6+ glands (intracholecystic tubular non-mucinous neoplasm-ICTN) forms a localized pedunculated polyp.

It is a potential candidate for developing intervention strategies to delay the development/progression of AMD. In the current study, the effect of a novel, highly purified BCX oral formulation on the rat retinal damage model was evaluated. Rats were fed with BCX for four weeks at the doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg body weight in the form of highly bioavailable oil suspension, followed by retinal damage by exposing to the bright light-emitting diode (LED) light (750 lux) for 48 hrs.

BCX supplementations (2 and 4 mg/kg) showed improvements in the visual condition as demonstrated by histopathology of the retina and measured parameters such as total retinal thickness and outer nuclear layer thickness. BCX supplementation helped reduce the burden of oxidative stress as seen by decreased serum and retinal tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and restored the antioxidant enzyme activities in BCX groups. Further, BCX supplementation modulated inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, and NF-κB), apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3), growth proteins and factors (GAP43, VEGF), glial and neuronal proteins (GFAP, NCAM), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), along with the mitochondrial stress markers (ATF4, ATF6, Grp78, Grp94) in the rat retinal tissue.

It is positioned between wheat and rye in terms of resistance to soilborne pathogens including Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Fusarium culmorum, F. avenaceum, and Bipolaris sorokiniana (Arseniuk and Góral 2015). In 2019, seven triticale fields were surveyed in Almaty Province, Kazakhstan to examine soil-borne fungal pathogens. A total of 28 symptomatic plants with stunting, rot or discolored root were collected to identify causal agents. The overall disease incidence was approximately 8 to 10% in the fields. Fungi were isolated from 3-5 mm pieces excised from symptomatic tissues. The pieces were exposed to surface disinfection in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, blotted dry, and plated on 1/5 strength potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 0.01% streptomycin. Plates were left in the dark at 23°C for 7 days. A total of 34 fungal colonies were isolated of which nineteen isolates, originally from six fields showed the cultural characteristics of B. sorokiniana. This species was previously reported to cause common root rot on triticale in Kazakhstan (Özer et al. 2020). Ten isolates from four fields produced pale orange and cottony mycelium with red pigmentation on the agar, which is typical of Fusarium-like growth. The remaining isolates (n=5) from two fields produced salmon-colored and scarce aerial mycelium with no soluble pigmentation, similar to Microdochium spp. Fusarium isolates produced thick-walled and curved macroconidia with 3-4 septa (n=50, 25.7 to 37.6 × 4.1 to 7.3 μm in size) and notched basal cell on PDA, but microconidia were absent, which matches the description of F. culmorum (Wm.G. Sm.) Sacc. (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Microdochium isolates produced swollen, brown, and thick-walled chlamydospores and hyaline, one-celled, and thin-walled conidia (n=50, 5.4 to 9.3 × 1.5 to 3.0 μm in size) formed on ampullate and cylindrical conidiogenous cells on oatmeal agar (OA). These morphological features are consistent with previous observations for Microdochium bolleyi (R. Sprague) de Hoog &amp; Herm.-Nijh. (Hong et al. 2008). To confirm morphological preliminary identifications, the portion of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) gene was amplified with EF1/EF2 primers (O'Donnell et al. 1998) for representative Fusarium isolates (n=4) for each field. Additionally, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA was amplified with ITS1/ITS4 primers (White et al. 1990) for representative Microdochium isolates (n=2) for each field. BLASTn queries against NCBI GenBank revealed that the EF1-α sequences of Fusarium isolates (MW311081-MW311084) shared 100% identity with F. culmorum strain CBS 110262 (KT008433). The ITS sequences of M. bolleyi isolates (MW301448-MW301449) matched that of M. bolleyi strain CBS 137.64 (AM502264) with 100% sequence similarity. Pathogenicity test was conducted on pregerminated seeds of triticale cv. Balausa. A plastic pot (17 cm height, 9 cm in diam) was filled with a sterile mixture of vermiculite, peat, and soil (1:1:1, v/v/v). Mycelial plugs (1 cm in diam) were cut from the margin of a growing culture of representative isolates (Kaz_Fus123 and Kaz_Mb01) and placed onto the mixture in the pot. A sterile agar plug was employed as a control treatment. One pregerminated seed was put on the plug and covered with the mixture. The pots were transferred to a growth chamber set at 23 ± 2°C and a photoperiod of 14 hours. The experiment was performed twice using 5 replication pots per isolate. Four weeks after inoculation, discoloration of the crown was observed on all the inoculated roots, whereas no symptoms were observed on the control plants. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reisolating and identifying the pathogen based on the morphology described above. This is the first report of M. bolleyi and F. culmorum causing root rot on triticale in Kazakhstan. Although B. sorokiniana is the most primary pathogen that may limit yield in the production of triticale in Kazakhstan, F. culmorum and M. bolleyi have been found to be less frequent and less aggressive pathogens, respectively. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential distribution and impact of these pathogens on triticale.",eng,Plant Dis,9882809,0191-2917,aheadofprint,33656364,10.1094/PDIS-12-20-2659-PDN,NA,NA,Plant Dis

Although several hypotheses have been suggested, the etiopathogenesis of SANT remains unknown. It is also unclear whether SANT is a reactive or a neoplastic lesion. Since CTNNB1 (β-catenin gene) exon 3 mutations were frequently detected in some rare fibrovascular lesions, we aimed to investigate the presence of oncogenic CTNNB1 mutations in SANT cases. For this purpose, 7 cases of SANT with typical histopathological features were retrieved. First, the presence of CTNNB1 exon 3 alterations was examined with a recently described immunohistochemistry-based method. Then, the findings were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and Sanger sequencing. In all cases, immunochemistry of β-catenin gave a staining pattern that was suggestive of exon 3 alteration; however, no missense mutations were found in any case at the CTNNB1 exon 3 hotspot region. Subsequently, we screened for large interstitial deletions of CTNNB1 exon 3 which revealed short PCR products in three cases. Sequencing confirmed that these cases had large interstitial deletions, resulting in loss of the entire exon 3 of CTNNB1. In the remaining four cases, loss of exon 3 was documented at the cDNA level, although genomic deletion was not identified. These results demonstrate that loss of CTNNB1 exon 3 and stabilization of β-catenin with activation of Wnt signaling pathway might have a significant role in the pathogenesis of SANT.

CD4+ T cells in patients with IPEX syndrome and Foxp3-deficient mice were analyzed by single-cell cytometry and RNA-sequencing, revealing heterogeneous Treg-like cells, some very similar to normal Treg cells, others more distant. Conventional T cells showed no widespread activation or helper T cell bias, but a monomorphic disease signature affected all CD4+ T cells. This signature proved to be cell extrinsic since it was extinguished in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice and heterozygous mothers of patients with IPEX syndrome. Normal Treg cells exerted dominant suppression, quenching the disease signature and revealing in mutant Treg-like cells a small cluster of genes regulated cell-intrinsically by FOXP3, including key homeostatic regulators. We propose a two-step pathogenesis model: cell-intrinsic downregulation of core FOXP3-dependent genes destabilizes Treg cells, de-repressing systemic mediators that imprint the disease signature on all T cells, furthering Treg cell dysfunction. Accordingly, interleukin-2 treatment improved the Treg-like compartment and survival.",eng,Nat Immunol,100941354,1529-2908,aheadofprint,33833438,10.1038/s41590-021-00910-8,NA,NA,Nat Immunol

In the affected male of family 2, we found this variant in a compound heterozygous state together with a novel frameshift variant (c.329_332delTCTG, p.Leu112Valfs*8), which is the second frameshift variant known so far in PYROXD1. We have been able to define a large homozygous region in family 1 sharing a common haplotype with family 2 in the critical region. Our data suggest that c.464A&gt;G is a Turkish founder mutation. To gain deeper insights, we performed a systematic review of all published PYROXD1-related myopathy cases. Our analysis showed that the c.464A &gt; G variant was found in 87% (20/23) of the patients and that it may cause either a childhood- or adult-onset phenotype, irrespective of its presence in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

They are among the important public health problems with increasing prevalence worldwide. Although it is claimed that there are strong relations between them, the mechanism of this relationship has not been fully clarified yet. On the other hand, the effect of this relationship on the offspring has been another research subject. In this study, obese zebrafish were obtained by feeding two different diets, one containing high amount of lipid (HF) and the other containing high amount of carbohydrate (HK), and their anxiety levels were evaluated. To establish a relationship between these two phenomena, in addition to histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis in the brain tissues of fish, the transcription levels of some genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms were determined. In addition, offspring were taken from obese zebrafish and studied to examine the effect of parental obesity on offspring. As a result, it was observed that the HC diet, causing more weight increase than the HF diet, showed an anxiolytic while the HF diet an anxiogenic effect. It was suggested that the probable cause of this situation may be the regulatory effect on the appetite-related genes depending on the upregulation severity of the PPAR gene family based on the diet content. In addition, it was also suggested that it may have contributed to this process in neuron degenerations caused by oxidative stress. Regarding effects on offspring, it can be concluded that HF diet-induced obesity has more negative effects on the next generation than the HC diet.Level of evidenceNo Level of evidence: animal study.",eng,Eat Weight Disord,9707113,1124-4909,aheadofprint,33710522,10.1007/s40519-021-01140-5,NA,NA,Eat Weight Disord

Although the liver is the primary organ responsible for metabolizing many compounds including pesticides, to the authors' knowledge there have been no studies on the direct hepatotoxic effects of 3-PBA. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible hepatotoxic effects of 3-PBA on a Human Hepatoma Cell Line (HepG2) and the underlying apoptotic mechanisms. Firstly, an LC50 of 1041.242 µM was calculated for 3-PBA by using the WST-1 test with concentrations ranging between 1 µM and 10 mM. Following that, the HepG2 cells in the experimental group were exposed to 3 different concentrations of 3-PBA (1/5 LC50, 1/10 LC50 and 1/20 LC50) for 24 hours. The apoptotic mechanism was evaluated by using flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays for Caspase 3 and Bcl-2. In the flow cytometry assay, the total number of apoptotic cells increased in a dose dependent manner (p &lt; 0.05). In the immunofluorescence assay, the Caspase 3 protein showed strong immunoreactivity in the experimental groups, while the reaction to the Bcl-2 protein was minimal. These results demonstrated that 3-PBA has a significant hepatotoxic effect on HepG2 cells and induces apoptosis via the regulation of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Furthermore, our results could further the understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of 3-PBA hepatotoxicity.

Although these represent significant risk factors or comorbidities for ischemic stroke, PHACTR1 role in brain small vessel ischemic disease and ischemic stroke most important survival mechanism, such as the recruitment of brain collateral arteries like posterior communicating arteries (PcomAs), remains unknown. Therefore, we applied exome and genome sequencing in a multi-ethnic cohort of 180 early-onset independent familial and apparently sporadic brain small vessel ischemic disease and CADASIL-like Caucasian patients from US, Portugal, Finland, Serbia and Turkey and in 2 C57BL/6J stroke mouse models (bilateral common carotid artery stenosis [BCCAS] and middle cerebral artery occlusion [MCAO]), characterized by different degrees of PcomAs patency. We report 3 very rare coding variants in the small vessel ischemic disease-CADASIL-like cohort (p.Glu198Gln, p.Arg204Gly, p.Val251Leu) and a stop-gain mutation (p.Gln273*) in one MCAO mouse. These coding variants do not cluster in PHACTR1 known pathogenic domains and are not likely to play a critical role in small vessel ischemic disease or brain collateral circulation. We also exclude the possibility that copy number variants (CNVs) or a variant enrichment in Phactr1 may be associated with PcomA recruitment in BCCAS mice or linked to diverse vascular traits (cerebral blood flow pre-surgery, PcomA size, leptomeningeal microcollateral length and junction density during brain hypoperfusion) in C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Genetic variability in PHACTR1 is not likely to be a common susceptibility factor influencing small vessel ischemic disease in patients and PcomA recruitment in C57BL/6J mice.

IL-22 is produced by RORγt+ innate and adaptive lymphocytes, including ILC3, γδ T, iNKT, Th17, and Th22 cells and some granulocytes. IL-22 receptor is expressed primarily by non-hematopoietic cells. IL-22 is critical for barrier immunity at the mucosal surfaces in the steady-state and during infection. Although IL-22 knockout mice were previously shown to develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), how temporal IL-22 manipulation in adult mice would affect EAE course has not been studied previously. In this study, we overexpressed IL-22 via hydrodynamic gene delivery or blocked it via neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice to explore the therapeutic impact of IL-22 modulation on the EAE course. IL-22 overexpression significantly decreased EAE scores, demyelination, and reduced infiltration of IFN-γ+IL-17A+ Th17 cells into the central nervous system (CNS). The neutralization of IL-22 did not alter the EAE pathology significantly. We show that IL-22 mediated protection is independent of Reg3γ, an epithelial cell-derived antimicrobial peptide induced by IL-22. Thus, overexpression of Reg3γ significantly exacerbated EAE scores, demyelination, and infiltration of IFN-γ+IL-17A+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ Th17 cells to CNS. We also show that Reg3γ may inhibit IL-2-mediated STAT5 signaling and impair expansion of Treg cells in vivo and in vitro.

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Twenty five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups (n = 5 per group): (i) control, (ii) 8-week dutasteride (0.5 mg/kg/day, in drinking water), (iii) 12-week dutasteride, (iv) 8-week dutasteride+HUCB-MNCs (1 × 106) and (v) 12-week dutasteride+HUCB-MNCs. HUCB-MNCs were administered intracavernosally after eight weeks of dutasteride treatment. Experiments were performed at 4 weeks following the injection of HUCB-MNCs. Erectile responses and isometric tension of corpus cavernosum (CC) were measured. The protein expressions of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and smooth muscle/collagen contents in penile tissue were evaluated by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively.                 Label=""MAIN OUTCOME"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In vivo erectile function, in vitro relaxant and contractile responses of CC, protein expression and localization of PDE5, eNOS, nNOS, HIF-1α, and smooth muscle content in penile tissue.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Erectile responses in the dutasteride-treated groups were significantly decreased compared with controls (P &lt; .001), persisting after 4-wk of washout. HUCB-MNCs restored diminished intracavernosal pressure responses, acetylcholine-, sodium nitroprusside-, sildenafil-induced relaxations, and increased phenylephrine and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions. Decreased EFS-induced relaxations in dutasteride-treated groups were not restored by HUCB-MNCs. Increased PDE5 and reduced nNOS expressions in dutasteride groups were restored by HUCB-MNCs in the 12-week dutasteride group. eNOS and HIF-1α protein expression and serum total and free testosterone  levels were similar among groups. HUCB-MNCs reversed the decreased smooth muscle/collagen ratio in dutasteride-treated tissues. There was a significant increase in PDE5 and HIF-1α staining in 8-week dutasteride animals.                 Label=""CLINICAL TRANSLATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":This study demonstrates the corrective potential of HUCB-MNCs on some persistent structural and functional deterioration caused by 5ARI treatment in rats, which may encourage further evaluation of HUCB-MNCs in men with PPED.                 Label=""STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Therapeutic application of intracavernosal HUCB-MNCs is a novel approach for the rat model of post-5ARI ED.

Management of this disease, most often through the use of resistant cultivars and crop rotation, requires an accurate understanding of an area's pathogen population structure and phenotypic characteristics. This study improved the understanding of the state's pathogen population by completing multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of two housekeeping genes (BT and TEF) and two loci (ITS and IGS), aggressiveness and race-determining bioassays on 72 isolates collected between 2011 and 2015 from major watermelon production areas in North, Central, and South Florida. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) failed to group race 3 isolates into a single large clade; moreover, clade membership was not apparently correlated with aggressiveness (which varied both within and between clades), and only slightly with sampling location. The failure of multilocus sequence analysis using four highly conserved housekeeping genes and loci to clearly group and delineate known Fon races provides justification for future whole genome sequencing efforts whose more robust genomic comparisons will provide higher resolution of intra-species genetic distinctions. Consequently, these results suggest that identification of Fon isolates by race determination alone may fail to detect economically important phenotypic characteristics such as aggressiveness leading to inaccurate risk assessment.",eng,PLoS One,101285081,1932-6203,epublish,33764995,10.1371/journal.pone.0248364,16,3,PLoS One

33779261,2021,3,0191-2917,Plant disease,First Report of Crown Rot Caused by Fusarium redolens on Wheat in Kazakhstan.,10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0015-PDN,"Fusarium crown rot, caused by several species within the genus, is a major constraint that results in significant losses in wheat production worldwide. In June 2019, diseased wheat plants with typical symptoms of crown rot, including discoloration on the first two or three internodes of the stem just above the soil line and stunted, dry rotted, and discolored roots were collected in several bread wheat fields during the maturity stage in Almaty, East Kazakhstan, and Karaganda Regions of Kazakhstan. For each field, approximately twenty tillers were randomly sampled. Symptomatic tissues were surface sterilized in 1% NaClO for 2 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water three times, air-dried in a laminar flow hood, and then transferred to Petri dishes containing one-fifth strength potato dextrose agar (PDA). After incubating in the dark at 23°C for 5 days, 79 single-spore isolates showing cultural and microscopic characteristics of Fusarium were obtained on PDA and Spezieller-Nährstoffarmer agar (SNA). Colonies were initially white but later produced a beige to pink diffusible pigment in PDA. Microconidia that formed on aerial monophialides were hyaline, 0 to 1 septum, oval- to kidney-shaped, and measured 4.3 to 10.3 × 1.9 to 3.4 µm (average 7.8 × 2.6 µm), whilst macroconidia were straight to slightly curved, 3 to 5 septate, and measured 18.7 to 38.8 × 2.9 to 6.6 µm (average 29.9 × 4.7 µm), with foot-shaped basal cells on SNA. Chlamydospores were present on PDA. Sequence analysis based on portions of translation elongation factor 1α (TEF1) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS rDNA) loci with primers EF1/EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998) and ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) identified 29 of the 79 isolates as Fusarium redolens Wollenw. The sequences of the five representative isolates with 99.85% of similarity to those of F. redolens strains available in GenBank e.g., ITS (MT435063) and TEF1 (GU250584). The TEF1 (accession nos. MW403914-MW403918) and ITS rDNA (accession nos. MW397138-MW397142) sequences of the isolates were deposited in GenBank. The morphological features are consistent with the described features of F. redolens (Leslie and Summerell 2006). To confirm pathogenicity of the five isolates, five pre-germinated seeds of wheat cultivar Seri 82 were placed in a 9-cm-diameter pot filled with a sterile potting mix containing equal volumes of peat, vermiculite, and soil. An approximately 1-cm-diameter 7-day-old mycelial plug of each isolate was individually placed in contact with the seeds. Seeds were covered with the same potting mix, and then the pots were maintained for four weeks in a growth chamber at 23°C with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was conducted twice with three replicate 15-cm pots with 5 plants per pot. Controls were inoculated with sterile agar plugs using the same procedure. After four weeks, all the inoculated plants showed stunted growth with brown discoloration in most parts of the crown and roots, whereas no symptoms were observed in the control plants. The mean severity of the disease for each isolate was between 2.1 and 2.7 according to the scale of 1 to 5 described by Gebremariam et al. (2015). The pathogen was reisolated from crowns of diseased plants, but not from asymptomatic control tissues, and identified morphologically based on the methods described above, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Although several morphological features are shared by F. oxysporum and F. redolens, Baayen et al. (2001) showed that these species could be easily distinguished using molecular data. The pathogen was previously reported as F. redolens associated with crown rot of wheat in Turkey (Gebremariam et al. 2015) and Saskatchewan, Canada (Taheri et al. 2011). The presence of F. redolens causing crown rot is confirmed in the six wheat fields surveyed in Kazakhstan, for the first time. This pathogen may pose a risk for wheat production, and further studies needed to determine the impact on the crop in Kazakhstan.",eng,Plant Dis,9882809,0191-2917,aheadofprint,33779261,10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0015-PDN,NA,NA,Plant Dis

Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or to induce cellular T cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health. Indeed, academic and private companies have ongoing joint efforts to develop novel vaccine prototypes for this virus. Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as 'tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens' (TACA). Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective IgG responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the latest advancements in development of vaccines against glycan epitopes to gain selective immune responses, and to provide an overview on the role of different immunogenic constructs in improving glycovaccine efficacy.",eng,FEBS J,101229646,1742-464X,aheadofprint,33934527,10.1111/febs.15909,NA,NA,FEBS J

In this study, we performed a statistical meta-analysis to identify miRNAs and a class compassion analysis to evaluate mRNAs with the power to discriminate between normal, intraepithelial lesions and invasive cancer samples. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were compared with the targets of meta-miRNAs. After bioinfomatics analysis and qRT-PCR validations with cytology samples and FFPE tissues, we defined miR-25 and its target KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4) as candidate biomarkers for in vitro studies. Our results showed that miR-25 expression was significantly higher in precancerous lesions and invasive carcinoma while presenting consistent expression patterns in both cytological and FFPE tissue samples. In line with this, its direct target KLF4 expression decreased in precancerous lesions in cytological samples and also in the invasive cancer group in FFPE tissues.

After scanning the other quadrants, however, the tumor was not observed at the right ureteral orifice. It was then protruded back into the bladder. The tumor was seen several times to protrude into the bladder and return to the ureter, possibly due to ureteral peristalsis. Then, a semi-rigid ureteroscope was introduced through the right ureteric orifice, and the tumor was excised in one piece using Holmium laser fiber with 365μm of diameter. The size of the removed tumor was approximately 8 cm long. A double-j stent of 4.8 Fr was placed in the ureter. RESULTS: The patient was discharged on the first day without complications. The fibroepithelial polyps of the ureter, which consist of the stroma of mesoderm origin, covered with histologically normal or hyperplastic urothelial epithelial cells, are extremely rare tumors. It is important to distinguish these polyps from urothelial cancers, since these two entities are different in treatment and prognosis, although similar in symptoms and imaging procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive treatment techniques can be safely applied in the treatment of such exceedingly rare tumors.

We aimed to search the attributes of steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma (SH-HCC) and steatotic-HCC in our series. A retrospective clinicopathologic analyses of 150 HCCs and immunostaining for C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were performed. Tumors were reclassified as all SH-HCC, limited SH-HCC, typical SH-HCC (steatohepatitic features in &gt;5%, 5% to 50%, and ≥50% of the tumor, respectively), steatotic-HCC, and classic HCC (C-HCC). Group comparisons were made using Kruskal-Wallis and Kaplan-Meier tests. The background etiology in all SH-HCCs was pure viral in 51.4%, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)/alcoholic liver disease (ALD) alone/mixed in 34.3%, and unidentified in normal liver in 14.3%. All SH-HCCS (n=35, 23.3%) and typical SH-HCCs (n=13, 8.6%) had higher NASH/ALD. Limited SH-HCCs (n=22, 14.6%) had higher ALD (all P&lt;0.05). Typical SH-HCCs tended to have more NASH (P=0.054).

A punch biopsy was taken from the patient with a preliminary diagnosis of lichen planus and lichenoid drug reaction. The histopathological examination showed hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis and hypergranulosis. Systemic methylprednisolone, levocetrizine and topical methylprednisolone aceponate were planned for the therapy. To the best of our knowledge, the appearance of lichen planus after hirudotherapy was never reported in literature. Hence, physicians should keep in mind that lichen planus and similar dermatoses could be triggered due to hirudotherapy.

Overall, 72% (62-81) of the RI limits predicted by indirect methods showed significant biases from direct RIs. However, the biases observed in total cholesterol, lactic dehydrogenase, etc. were attributed to a higher-side age-bias in LIS dataset. After excluding them, the overall proportion of biased RIs reduced to 47% (38-54).

Current disease control methods include fly-repelling pesticides, fly trapping, and chemotherapeutic treatment of infected people and animals. Inhibiting tsetse's ability to transmit trypanosomes by strengthening the fly's natural barriers can serve as an alternative approach to reduce disease. The peritrophic matrix (PM) is a chitinous and proteinaceous barrier that lines the insect midgut and serves as a protective barrier that inhibits infection with pathogens. African trypanosomes must cross tsetse's PM in order to establish an infection in the fly, and PM structural integrity negatively correlates with trypanosome infection outcomes. Bloodstream form trypanosomes shed variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) into tsetse's gut lumen early during the infection establishment, and free VSG molecules are internalized by the fly's PM-producing cardia. This process results in a reduction in the expression of a tsetse microRNA (miR275) and a sequential molecular cascade that compromises PM integrity. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are critical in regulating many physiological processes. In the present study, we investigated the role(s) of tsetse miR275 by developing a paratransgenic expression system that employs tsetse's facultative bacterial endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, to express tandem antagomir-275 repeats (or miR275 sponges). This system induces a constitutive, 40% reduction in miR275 transcript abundance in the fly's midgut and results in obstructed blood digestion (gut weights increased by 52%), a significant increase (p-value &lt; 0.0001) in fly survival following infection with an entomopathogenic bacteria, and a 78% increase in trypanosome infection prevalence. RNA sequencing of cardia and midgut tissues from paratransgenic tsetse confirmed that miR275 regulates processes related to the expression of PM-associated proteins and digestive enzymes as well as genes that encode abundant secretory proteins. Our study demonstrates that paratransgenesis can be employed to study microRNA regulated pathways in arthropods that house symbiotic bacteria.",eng,PLoS Pathog,101238921,1553-7366,aheadofprint,34107000,10.1371/journal.ppat.1009475,17,6,PLoS Pathog

Phenotypes ranged from juvenile-onset pure hereditary spastic paraplegia to infantile-onset spasticity and global developmental delays, sometimes complicated by episodes of neurological and respiratory decompensation. Variants included bona fide pathogenic truncating changes, although most were missense substitutions. Functionality of variants could not be determined directly as the enzymatic specificity of HPDL is unknown; however, when HPDL missense substitutions were introduced into 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD, an HPDL orthologue), they impaired the ability of HPPD to convert 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate. Moreover, three additional sets of experiments provided evidence for a role of HPDL in the nervous system and further supported its link to neurological disease: (i) HPDL was expressed in the nervous system and expression increased during neural differentiation; (ii) knockdown of zebrafish hpdl led to abnormal motor behaviour, replicating aspects of the human disease; and (iii) HPDL localized to mitochondria, consistent with mitochondrial disease that is often associated with neurological manifestations.

The growth of a new network of blood vessels is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis, which is promoted by several proangiogenic factors. Leptin, an essential adipokine that is secreted from fat tissue, is one of these pro-angiogenic factors. It has been shown that the inhibition of leptin-induced angiogenesis resulted in decreased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR2, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α, NF-κB, IL-1 and Notch and reduced the tumor growth in breast cancer. Leptin induces angiogenesis in breast cancer either by upregulating VEGFR2 in endothelial cells or by increasing VEGF/VEGFR2 expression through the Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) pathway. NILCO is a novel mechanism that interacts with proinflammatory and proangiogenic signals, which are critical for cell proliferation and angiogenesis in cancer. Several studies have shown that components of NILCO may affect human cancer incidence and progression. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interactions between Notch, IL-1 and leptin in human colorectal cancer have not been yet studied at the molecular level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression levels of genes related to the NILCO pathway in human colorectal cancer specimens. The current results demonstrated that leptin, leptin receptor (ObR) b, Notch-1, Notch-4, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1R, IL-6, JAK-2, STAT-1, STAT-3, VEGFA, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, TNF-α and NF-κB mRNA expression levels in the cancer tissue were increased compared with the normal tissue. No significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of Jagged-1, HIF-1α and TNF receptor 1 were observed. Western blotting revealed that the protein expression levels of IκB were increased in the cancer tissue compared with normal tissue, whereas HIF-1α and phosphorylated STAT-1 levels were decreased. IL-6 and VEGFA plasma concentrations were statistically raised and the leptin plasma concentration was also raised, although significantly, patients with cancer compared with control individuals.

However, the results of studies investigating the cancer association with PPARgamma are inconsistent, creating a need for further investigation of the effects of this transcription factor on BC risk. We have examined the Pro12Ala-(rs1801282) and C161T-(rs3856806) polymorphisms of the PPARgamma gene in Turkish patients with BC in this case-control study. A total of 95 women diagnosed with BC as cases and 119 controls were genotyped for PPARgamma polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques.

This study was performed on 44 Wistar-albino female rats. Groups were designed as Control; Sham; I/R (the left ovary was ligated for 2 h and then reperfused for 2 h); I/R + DiOHF (after 2 h ischaemia and 2 h reperfusion, 30 mg/kg of DiOHF was given intraperitoneally and reperfusion was allowed for 2 h more); I + DiOHF + R (after 2 h I, 30 mg/kg of DiOHF was given at the beginning of 2 h reperfusion); DiOHF + I/R (2 h after DiOHF administration, the left ovary was ligated for 2 h and then reperfused for 2 h). Blood and ovarian tissue samples were analysed for GSH, MDA, 8-OHdG, SOD, and IL-6. Ovarian tissue was examined histopathologically. Ovarian I/R has led to inflammation and oxidative damage. However, DiOHF activated the antioxidant system and prevented DNA damage induced by I/R in ovarian tissue. Vascularisation, oedema, and inflammation also occurred in ovarian tissue in I/R group. The results of this study indicated that I/R led to disturbance of the oxidant/antioxidant system balance and increased DNA damage; however, DiOHF supplementation prevented DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and inflammation by increasing the antioxidant system in ovarian I/R injury in rats. However, in potential I/R situations, DiOHF application appears to be beneficial in reducing inflammation, oxidant injury, and DNA damage, and in activating the antioxidant system.

We retrospectively reviewed the patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma who underwent primary surgical treatment in a tertiary referral hospital. Sixty-nine patients having squamous differentiation constituted the case group. Each woman in the case group was matched with two patients in the control group based on age, disease stage, tumour grade, lymphovascular space invasion, tumour size, myometrial invasion, type of surgery and adjuvant therapy. During the follow-up, the recurrence rates were similar between the case (5/69, 7.2%) and control (10/138, 7.2%) groups (p = 1.0). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 90.2% for the case group and 88.6% for the control group (p = .51). The 5-year overall survival rate was 94.6% for the case group and 91.8% for the control group (p = .12). Squamous differentiation seems to have no impact on the prognosis of patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? A focus of squamous differentiation is recognised in 12.8-25% of women with endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The prognostic value of the squamous differentiation was evaluated in several previous studies. However, it could not be clarified due to the conflicting results of these studies.What do the results of this study add? The probable confounding effects of well-known prognostic factors including age at diagnosis, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stage, tumour grade, lymphovascular space invasion, tumour size, myometrial invasion, type of surgery and adjuvant therapy were eliminated with the case-control study design in the current study. Our findings indicate that the presence of squamous differentiation does not have any prognostic effect in endometrioid type endometrial cancer.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The molecular prognosticators of endometrial cancer were extensively studied in recent years. It is likely that clinicopathological and molecular prognostic factors will be integrated for predicting prognosis as a part of routine clinical practice soon. In this context, the prognostic value of the squamous differentiation in endometrioid adenocarcinomas may further be clarified by larger and multicentric studies that utilise central pathology review.",eng,J Obstet Gynaecol,8309140,0144-3615,aheadofprint,34155955,10.1080/01443615.2021.1916809,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

The study aimed to analyze the profile of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) among hospitalized patients with bacteremia in intensive care units (ICUs) in a large geographical area. This is a 1-month cross-sectional survey for blood-borne pathogens in 57 ICUs from 24 countries with different income levels: lower-middle-income (LMI), upper-middle-income (UMI), and high-income (HI) countries. Multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), or pan-drug-resistant isolates were searched. Logistic regression analysis determined resistance predictors among MDROs. Community-acquired infections were comparable to hospital-acquired infections particularly in LMI (94/202; 46.5% vs 108/202; 53.5%). Although MDR (65.1%; 502/771) and XDR (4.9%; 38/771) were common, no pan-drug-resistant isolate was recovered. In total, 32.1% of MDR were Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 55.3% of XDR were Acinetobacter baumannii. The highest MDR and XDR rates were in UMI and LMI, respectively, with no XDR revealed from HI. Predictors of MDR acquisition were male gender (OR, 12.11; 95% CI, 3.025-15.585) and the hospital-acquired origin of bacteremia (OR, 2.643; 95%CI, 1.462-3.894), and XDR acquisition was due to bacteremia in UMI (OR, 3.344; 95%CI, 1.189-5.626) and admission to medical-surgical ICUs (OR, 1.481; 95% CI, 1.076-2.037). We confirm the urgent need to expand stewardship activities to community settings especially in LMI, with more paid attention to the drugs with a higher potential for resistance.

Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (ARv7) is the most commonly observed isoform and strongly correlates with resistance to second-generation antiandrogens. Despite this clinical evidence, the interplay between ARv7 and the highly expressed full-length AR (ARfl) remains unclear. In this work we show that ARfl/ARv7 heterodimers readily form in the nucleus via an intermolecular N/C interaction that brings the four termini of the proteins in close proximity. Combining FRET and FRAP we demonstrate that these heterodimers undergo conformational changes following DNA binding indicating dynamic nuclear receptor interaction. Although transcriptionally active, ARv7 can only form short-term interactions with DNA at highly accessible, high-occupancy ARfl binding sites. Dimerization with ARfl does not affect ARv7 binding dynamics suggesting that DNA binding occupancy is determined by the individual protein monomers and not the homo- or heterodimer complex. Overall, these biophysical studies reveal detailed properties of ARv7 dynamics as both a homodimer or heterodimer with ARfl.",eng,J Cell Sci,0052457,0021-9533,aheadofprint,34155516,10.1242/jcs.258332,NA,NA,J Cell Sci

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Thirty-six children with nephropathic cystinosis were included in the study. Clinical features, molecular genetic diagnoses, and kidney outcomes of the patients were evaluated.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Twenty-one children (58.3%) were male. The median age at diagnosis was 18.5 months. Twenty-eight patients (77.8%) had infantile nephropathic cystinosis, while eight (22.2%) had juvenile nephropathic cystinosis. An acute rapid deterioration of the kidney function with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and nephrotic syndrome, was observed in 37.5% of patients with the juvenile form. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 82.31 ± 37.45 ml/min/1.73m2 at diagnosis and 63.10 ± 54.60 ml/min/1.73m2 at the last visit (p = 0.01). Six patients (16.6%) had kidney replacement therapy (KRT) at the last visit. The median age of patients with kidney failure was 122 months. Patients with a spot urine protein/creatinine ratio &lt; 6 mg/mg at the time of diagnosis had better kidney outcomes (p = 0.01). The most common allele was c.451A&gt;G (32.6%). The patients with the most common mutation tended to have higher mean eGFR and lower leukocyte cystine levels than patients with other mutations.

Transcriptomic and whole-exome analyses of bone metastasis from these mice revealed distinct molecular profiles conserved between human and mouse and specific patterns of subclonal branching from the primary tumor. Integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse and human datasets with functional studies in vivo unravels a unique MYC/RAS co-activation signature associated with prostate cancer metastasis.

Label=""Methods"":Active metabolic areas of each section were manually drawn by region of interest to calculate the MTV of nodules, and all obtained values were then summed. TLG, the product of mean standardized uptake value and MTV, was calculated by multiplying two values. All participants underwent thyroid ultrasonography imaging. All nodules were divided into risk classes according to the European Thyroid Image Reporting and Data System (EU-TIRADS) that was developed by the European Thyroid Association. The American Thyroid Association Guidelines were used to determine which thyroid nodules would undergo thyroid fine-needle biopsy (FNAB). Results were classified according to the Bethesda scoring system.                 Label=""Results"":TLG levels were significantly higher in malignant or malignant-suspicious nodules than in benign nodules (p=0.013). Although MTV levels were high in malignant or malignant-suspicious nodules than in benign and non-diagnostic nodules, it was statistically insignificant at limit values (p=0.079). Areas under curve (AUC) were 0.726 (p=0.005) and AUC: 0.668 (p=0.039) for TLG and MTV, respectively. The 2.3 g cut-off value of TLG has a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 59.0%.

Peripheral and brain cholesterol levels are largely independent due to the impermeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), highlighting the importance of studying the role of brain cholesterol homeostasis in AD. We first tested whether metabolite markers of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism were altered in AD and associated with AD pathology using linear mixed-effects models in two brain autopsy samples from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Religious Orders Study (ROS). We next tested whether genetic regulators of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism were altered in AD using the ANOVA test in publicly available brain tissue transcriptomic datasets. Finally, using regional brain transcriptomic data, we performed genome-scale metabolic network modeling to assess alterations in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism reactions in AD. We show that AD is associated with pervasive abnormalities in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism. Using transcriptomic data from Parkinson's disease (PD) brain tissue samples, we found that gene expression alterations identified in AD were not observed in PD, suggesting that these changes may be specific to AD. Our results suggest that reduced de novo cholesterol biosynthesis may occur in response to impaired enzymatic cholesterol catabolism and efflux to maintain brain cholesterol levels in AD.

In particular, TGF-β/SMAD induces growth arrest, and SMAD4 induces the expression of target genes such as p21WAF1 and p15INK4b through its interaction with several cofactors. Thus, inactivating mutations or the homozygous deletion of SMAD4 could be related to tumorigenesis or malignancy progression. However, in some cancer types, SMAD4 is neither mutated nor deleted. In the current study, we demonstrate that TGF-β signaling with a preserved SMAD4 function can contribute to cancer through associations with negative pathway regulators. We found that nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) is a novel interaction SMAD4 partner that inhibits TGF-β/SMAD4-induced p15INK4b mRNA expression by binding to SMAD4. Furthermore, we confirmed that NRF1 directly binds to the core region of the SMAD4 promoter, thereby decreasing SMAD4 mRNA expression.

Its clinical utility as an oral anticancer agent, however, is limited by poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal toxicity. Fosciclopirox, the phosphoryloxymethyl ester of CPX (Ciclopirox Prodrug, CPX-POM), selectively delivers the active metabolite, CPX, to the entire urinary tract following parenteral administration. We characterized the activity of CPX-POM and its major metabolites in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of high-grade urothelial cancer. CPX inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroid formation, and increased cell cycle arrest at S and G0/G1 phases. Mechanistically, CPX suppressed activation of Notch signaling. Molecular modeling and cellular thermal shift assays demonstrated CPX binding to γ-secretase complex proteins Presenilin 1 and Nicastrin, which are essential for Notch activation. To establish in vivo preclinical proof of principle, we tested fosciclopirox in the validated N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) mouse bladder cancer model. Once-daily intraperitoneal administration of CPX-POM for four weeks at doses of 235 mg/kg and 470 mg/kg significantly decreased bladder weight, a surrogate for tumor volume, and resulted in a migration to lower stage tumors in CPX-POM treated animals. This was coupled with a reduction in the proliferation index. Additionally, there was a reduction in Presenilin 1 and Hes-1 expression in the bladder tissues of CPX-POM treated animals. Following the completion of the first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT03348514), the pharmacologic activity of fosciclopirox is currently being characterized in a Phase 1 expansion cohort study of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients scheduled for cystectomy (NCT04608045) as well as a Phase 2 trial of newly diagnosed and recurrent urothelial cancer patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (NCT04525131).",eng,Cell Death Dis,101524092,NA,epublish,34059639,10.1038/s41419-021-03836-z,12,6,Cell Death Dis

The resulting sequences of 693 bp length were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MW898143:MW898146). These sequences were 100% identical to the isolate 8Rs of R. solani AG2-1 (accession no. AF354063). To confirm the pathogenicity of the four isolates, the colonized wheat kernels method described by Demirci (1998) was used to inoculate a sterile potting mix containing peat, vermiculite, and soil (1:1:1 by v/v/v) into which wheat (cv. Seri) was planted. Control pots were inoculated with sterile wheat kernels using the same procedure. Wheat plants were left to grow for four weeks under controlled environmental conditions with a 23°C temperature regime. During the period that the plants remained in the glasshouse, the typical light regime was 16 h. Brown lesions were observed on the roots of plants in the inoculated pots whereas no symptoms were observed on plants grown in the control pots. R. solani was consistently reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby confirming Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani AG2-1 on roots of wheat in Kazakhstan. R. solani AG2-1 isolates have been previously reported to be a weak pathogen to wheat (Roberts and Sivasithamparam 1986; Sturrock et al. 2015; Jaaffar et al. 2016; Özer et al. 2019). We suggest further studies are required to characterize the impact of R. solani AG2-1 in wheat. Considering crop rotation, the selection of non-host crops to this AG group is important to pathogen management, by reducing the amount of inoculum in the soil.",eng,Plant Dis,9882809,0191-2917,aheadofprint,34032487,10.1094/PDIS-04-21-0786-PDN,NA,NA,Plant Dis

PCNSL is generally located around the ventricle and is often detected as multiple lesions. It is rarely seen in the area of the hypothalamus.                 Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We report the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian woman with progressive short-term memory deterioration, headache, mental confusion, diabetes insipidus (DI) and hypopituitarism. Early findings were suggestive of a pituitary apoplexy. The results of tests performed during the initial admission at the tertiary health center revealed hypernatremia, hypopituitarism and DI. Intravenous hydrocortisone treatment was initiated for the secondary adrenal insufficiency, and 75 mcg/day of levothyroxine was started for the secondary hypothyroidism on the fourth day following hydrocortisone treatment. A daily dose of 120 mg desmopressin melt tablet was started twice a day for polyuria/polydipsia after the patient's volume status was balanced. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a mass lesion in the hypothalamic area, which was surrounded by marked edema. Anti-edema treatment was initially started considering the suggestion by our neurosurgery team. The patient's clinical and laboratory findings improved after the initiation of the anti-edema therapy. Afterwards, a biopsy was performed, which diagnosed a malignant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Subsequently, intravenous high-dose methotrexate-based therapy was started; however, after the second cycle of chemotherapy, the patient died due to sepsis.

In this study, we investigated the effects of kefir supplementation on the intestine-liver-adipose tissue axis in metabolic disorder induced by high-fructose diet in rats to describe mechanistic action and potential therapeutic value of kefir. Fructose was given to the rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 15 weeks. Kefir was administrated by gastric gavage once a day during the final six weeks. Kefir supplementation improved metabolic parameters, including plasma triglyceride and insulin levels; hepatic weight, triglyceride content and fatty degeneration; omental fat mass in fructose-fed rats. Kefir supplementation decreased the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in feces, as well as necrotic degeneration, expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but increased expression of tight-junction proteins occludin and claudin-1, in the ileum of the fructose-fed rats. Kefir treatment also reduced the mRNA levels of key lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) together with a decline in expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), NF-κB, and glycosylated glycoprotein (CD68) in the liver.

Consequently, kefir supplementation suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and inflammatory status, but promotes insulin signaling, in association with a change of the fecal microbiota and attenuation of the intestinal permeability factors in high-fructose-fed rats.

Biomaterials used in GBR are expected to produce sufficient volume and quality of bone swiftly. This study aims to histologically evaluate the effectiveness of the use of Hyalonect membranes alone or with autogenous grafts in intraosseous defects. Materials and Methods: This study is an experimental study on sheep. Surgeries were performed under general anesthesia in accordance with ethical rules. Five 10 mm defects were surgically created in each ilium of six sheep. One defect was left empty in each ilium (group ED). The defects in the experimental group were covered with Hyalonect membrane while unfilled (group HY) or after being filled with autogenous bone grafts (ABG) (group G+HY). In the control group, the defects were either covered with collagen membrane while unfilled (group CM) or after being filled with the ABG group (G+CM). The sheep were histologically and histomorphometrically evaluated after being postoperatively sacrificed in the third and sixth week (three animals in each interval). Results: All animals completed the study without any complications. No difference was found between groups in the third and sixth weeks regarding the inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis scores. The G+CM (52.83 ± 3.06) group was observed to have a significantly higher new bone formation rate than all the other groups in the third week, followed by the G+HY group (46.33 ± 2.25). Similar values were found for HY and CM groups (35.67 ± 4.55 ve 40.00 ± 3.41, respectively, p = 0.185), while the lowest values were observed to be in group ED (19.67 ± 2.73). The highest new bone formation was observed in group G+CM (82.33 ± 4.08) in the sixth week. There was no difference in new bone formation rates between groups G+CM, G+HY (77.17 ± 3.49, p = 0.206), and CM (76.50 ± 2.43, p = 0.118).

The records of 31 women who underwent myomectomy for FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas in a university hospital setting were analysed. Group I (n = 16) was composed of women that were symptomatic for AUB and group II (n = 15) consisted of asymptomatic cases. The myomectomy material(s) of each case were processed with CD34 staining and evaluated by Image J® software (Image J 1.52a, Wayne Rasband National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). There was no statistically significant difference between the rates of vascular areas in the specimens of the two groups (p&gt;.05). Although areas with large vessels were higher in group I compared to group II, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p&gt;.05). AUB caused by FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas seems to be related to factors other than vascular density.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign gynaecologic neoplasms with a prevalence of approximately 40% in women of reproductive age. They are most often asymptomatic but when symptomatic, abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is one of the most commonly observed symptoms. Although there are some hypothetical explanations, the exact pathogenesis underlying leiomyoma-associated AUB has not yet been elucidated. Almost a century ago, the vascular abnormalities of fibroids were hypothesised as one of the etiopathological factors correlated with clinical symptoms, such as AUB, and current data suggest that the vascular map of leiomyomas consists of an avascular core surrounded by a vascularised capsule. To our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature comparing the histopathological evaluation of the vascularity scores of FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas in symptomatic (with AUB) and asymptomatic (without AUB) women.What the results of this study add? The study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the vascularity scores of FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas excised from the symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Large vessel densities also did not statistically significantly differ between the two groups.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

Bisphosphonates was an effective material for the acceleration of bone formation in DO procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the systemic zoledronic acid application at the beginning of the consolidation period on new bone genesis in a DO model of rat femurs. The rats were divided randomly into 3 groups, as follows: Control group (CNT group) (n = 10), zoledronic acid dosage-1 (n = 10), and dosage-2 (n = 10) groups (ZA-D-1 and ZA-D-2). No treatment was administered in controls, but DO was applied to the rat femurs. A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg of zoledronic acid was administered systematically at the beginning of the consolidation period after the distraction in treatment groups, respectively. Histomorphometric analyses were performed on the original distracted bone area and the surrounding bone tissue. Osteoblasts, new bone formation, and fibrosis were scored. New bone formation in the ZA-D-1 and ZA-D-2 groups, when compared with the control group, was detected highly (P &lt; 0.05).

While eight IL-21R-deficient patients have been reported previously, the natural course, immune characteristics of disease, and response to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remain to be comprehensively examined. In our study, we have collected clinical histories of 13 patients with IL-21R deficiency from eight families across seven centers worldwide, including five novel patients identified by exome or NGS panel sequencing. Eight unique mutations in IL21R were identified in these patients, including two novel mutations. Median age at disease onset was 2.5 years (0.5-7 years). The main clinical manifestations were recurrent bacterial (84.6%), fungal (46.2%), and viral (38.5%) infections; cryptosporidiosis-associated cholangitis (46.2%); and asthma (23.1%). Inflammatory skin diseases (15.3%) and recurrent anaphylaxis (7.9%) constitute novel phenotypes of this combined immunodeficiency. Most patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced proportions of memory B cells, circulating T follicular helper cells, MAIT cells and terminally differentiated NK cells. However, IgE levels were elevated in 50% of IL-21R-deficient patients.

We determined cardiac Wt1 expression during embryonic development, in the adult, and after cardiac injury by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. As in vitro model, phenotypic cardiomyocyte differentiation, i.e., the appearance of rhythmically beating clones from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and associated changes in gene expression were analyzed. We detected Wt1 in cardiomyocytes from embryonic day (E10.5), the first time point investigated, until adult age. Cardiac Wt1 mRNA levels decreased during embryonic development. In the adult, Wt1 was reactivated in cardiomyocytes 48 h and 3 weeks following myocardial infarction. Wt1 mRNA levels were increased in differentiating mESCs. Overexpression of Wt1(-KTS) and Wt1(+KTS) isoforms in ES cells reduced the fraction of phenotypically cardiomyocyte differentiated clones, which was preceded by a temporary increase in c-kit expression in Wt1(-KTS) transfected ES cell clones and induction of some cardiomyocyte markers.

CAF inhibition is thus an ideal component of any therapeutic approach for PDAC. SLC7A11, a cystine transporter, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in PDAC cells. However, the role of SLC7A11 in PDAC tumor stroma and its prognostic significance has not been evaluated. Here we show that high expression of SLC7A11 in human PDAC tumor stroma, but not tumor cells, is independently prognostic of poor overall survival. Orthogonal approaches showed that PDAC-derived CAFs were dependent on SLC7A11 for cystine uptake and glutathione synthesis. SLC7A11 inhibition significantly decreased CAF proliferation, reduced their resistance to oxidative stress, and inhibited their ability to remodel collagen and support PDAC cell growth. Specific ablation of SLC7A11 from the tumor compartment of transgenic mice did not affect PDAC growth, suggesting the stroma can substantially influence PDAC response to SLC7A11 inhibition. In an orthotopic PDAC mouse model utilizing human PDAC cells and CAFs, stable knockdown of SLC7A11 was required in both cell types to reduce tumor growth, metastatic spread, and intratumoral fibrosis, demonstrating the importance of targeting SLC7A11 in both compartments. Finally, treatment with a nanoparticle SLC7A11-silencing drug developed by our laboratory reduced PDAC tumor growth, metastasis, CAF activation, and fibrosis in orthotopic PDAC tumors.

Radiographic response was assessed per RECIST 1.1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC). Primary endpoints: 1) 4-month disease control (DCR, complete/partial response [CR/PR] or stable disease [SD]) or an overall response (ORR, CR/PR) at any point in ≥10% of patients, per RECIST 1.1; 2) dose-limiting toxicity within 3 months not exceeding 30%. Secondary endpoint was lesion-specific response. Seventy-four patients (NSCLC, n=38; melanoma n=21) were analyzed (39 HD-RT and 35 HD-RT+LD-RT). The median follow-up time was 13.6 months. The primary endpoint was met for 72 evaluable patients, with a 4-month DCR of 42% (47% [16/34] vs. 37% [14/38] in HD-RT+LD-RT vs. HD-RT, P=0.38), and 19% ORR at any time (26% [9/34] vs. 13% [5/38] in HD-RT+LD-RT vs. HD-RT, P =0.27). Three patients had toxicity ≥grade 3. LD-RT lesion response (53%) was improved compared to nonirradiated lesions in HD-RT+LD-RT (23%, P =0.002) and HD-RT (11%, P <0.001). T- and NK cell infiltration was enhanced in lesions treated with LD-RT. HD-RT plus LD-RT safely improved lesion-specific response in patients with immune resistant solid tumors by promoting infiltration of effector immune cells into the tumor microenvironment.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34237343,NA,NA,NA,Radiother Oncol

Twenty-three consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD who underwent T2 mapping between December 2013 and September 2014 were included in this study. All patients underwent fast spin echo multi-echo sequence with eight echoes for T2 measurements. The mean liver T2 value and percentage of histological steatosis was 64.9 ± 7.4 ms and 46.5 ± 27.6%, respectively. There was a good correlation between the liver T2 value and histology-determined steatosis (r = 0.780, p<0.001) and grade of steatosis (r s  = 0.779, p<0.001). The mean T2 value in patients with definitive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was significantly higher in comparison with patients without NASH (69 ± 7.37 versus 61.73 ± 5.99 ms, p=0.016).

Recently, both factors of a gene-for-gene interaction between Z. tritici and wheat, the wheat receptor-like kinase Stb6 and the Z. tritici secreted effector protein AvrStb6, have been identified. Previous analyses revealed a high diversity of AvrStb6 haplotypes present in earlier Z. tritici isolate collections, with up to c.18% of analysed isolates possessing the avirulence isoform of AvrStb6 identical to that originally identified in the reference isolate IPO323. With Stb6 present in many commercial wheat cultivars globally, we aimed to assess potential changes in AvrStb6 genetic diversity and the incidence of haplotypes allowing evasion of Stb6-mediated resistance in more recent Z. tritici populations. Here we show, using targeted resequencing of AvrStb6, that this gene is universally present in field isolates sampled from major wheat-growing regions of the world in 2013-2017. However, in contrast to the data from previous AvrStb6 population studies, we report a complete absence of the originally described avirulence isoform of AvrStb6 amongst modern Z. tritici isolates. Moreover, a remarkably small number of haplotypes, each encoding AvrStb6 protein isoforms conditioning virulence on Stb6-containing wheat, were found to predominate among modern Z. tritici isolates. A single virulence isoform of AvrStb6 was found to be particularly abundant throughout the global population.

34363951,2021,8,NA,NA,hMOB2 deficiency impairs homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair and sensitises cancer cells to PARP inhibitors.,NA,"Monopolar spindle-one binder (MOBs) proteins are evolutionarily conserved and contribute to various cellular signalling pathways. Recently, we reported that hMOB2 functions in preventing the accumulation of endogenous DNA damage and a subsequent p53/p21-dependent G1/S cell cycle arrest in untransformed cells. However, the question of how hMOB2 protects cells from endogenous DNA damage accumulation remained enigmatic. Here, we uncover hMOB2 as a regulator of double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). hMOB2 supports the phosphorylation and accumulation of the RAD51 recombinase on resected single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs. Physiologically, hMOB2 expression supports cancer cell survival in response to DSB-inducing anti-cancer compounds. Specifically, loss of hMOB2 renders ovarian and other cancer cells more vulnerable to FDA-approved PARP inhibitors. Reduced MOB2 expression correlates with increased overall survival in patients suffering from ovarian carcinoma. Taken together, our findings suggest that hMOB2 expression may serve as a candidate stratification biomarker of patients for HR-deficiency targeted cancer therapies, such as PARP inhibitor treatments.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34363951,NA,NA,NA,Cell Signal

Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by injecting 1 mL autologous blood into the cisterna magna of 13 animals (Group 3). The animals were sacrificed after 3 weeks of induction. The animals' sublingual ganglion and sublingual gland were excised for histopathological examination. The number of degenerated cells in the sublingual ganglion, secretory vesicles, and secretory granules in the sublingual gland that contain salivary components were estimated using Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) data analysis.

34363898,2021,8,NA,NA,The Crosstalk between H. pylori virulence factors and the PD1:PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in progression to gastric cancer.,NA,"The progression to gastric cancer has been linked to chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (programmed cell death -1, PD-1; programmed cell death -ligand 1, PD-L1) have a role in cancer immune escape. The relationship between H. pylori virulence factors with PD-1, PD-L1 T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 17 (Th17), and regulatory T cell (Treg) response genes, has not been thoroughly investigated in the development of gastric cancer. Therefore, we evaluated how H. pylori virulence factors influence the expression levels of immune-related genes in the development of gastric immunopathology. A total of 92 gastric tissues of normal controls and patients with gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer were examined for the expression of immune-checkpoint inhibitor genes (PD-1 PD-L1), Th1 (interferon- γ, IFN-γ), Th17 (interleukin- 17, IL-17, Retinoic-acid-receptor- related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t, RORγ-t), and Treg (Forkhead box P3, FOXP3) response genes with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, correlation of H. pylori virulence factors' (cytotoxin-associated gene A, cagA; vacuolating cytotoxin gene A, vacA (s1,s2,m1,m2); blood group antigen-binding adhesin gene A, babA, duodenal ulcer promoting gene A, dupA; the putative neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin homolog, hpaA; neutrophil-activating protein A napA; outer inflammatory protein A, oipA; urease A, ureA; and urease B, ureB) genotypes with a degree of inflammation and density of H. pylori were investigated. Next, the relationship between H. pylori virulence factors and immune-checkpoint inhibitor genes, and T-cell response genes was evaluated. Eventually, a decision tree model was developed to determine the clinical outcome of patients using expression data. The intensity of PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression was increased significantly in gastric tissue of patients with gastric ulcer (PD-1: 2.3 fold, p=0.01; PD-L1: 2.1 fold, p=0.004), and gastric cancer (PD-1: 2 fold, p= 0.04; PD-L1: 1.8 fold, p=0.05) compared with control subjects. Also, PD-1: PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in patients with gastritis, who were infected with a marked density of H. pylori compared with its mildly infected counterparts. Furthermore, a novel negative correlation was found between PD-1 (r= -0.43) and PD-L1 (r= -0.42) with FOXP3 in patients with gastritis. CagA-positive H. pylori strain's negative association with PD-L1 expression (r=-0.34) was detected in patients with gastritis. Interestingly, PD-1 mRNA expression correlated positively with vacA s2/m2, in gastritis (r=0.43) and ulcer (r=0.43) patients. Furthermore, PD-1: PDL1 expression negatively correlated with vacA m1/m2 (r=-0.43 for PD-1; r=-0.38 for PD-L1) in gastritis patients. Moreover, an inverse correlation of PDL1 was present with vacA m1 (r=0.52) and vacA s1/m1 (r=0.46) versus vacA m2 (r=-0.44) and vacA m1 (r=0.52) and vacA s1/m2 (r=-0.14) in ulcer patients, respectively. Also, a correlation of vacA m2 (r=-0.47) and vacA s1/s2 (r= 0.45) with PD-1 was detected in ulcer patients. In addition, a novel negative correlation between FOXP3 mRNA levels and napA was shown in patients with gastritis and ulcer (r=-0.59). Finally, a computer-based model that was developed showed that knowing the expression levels of PD-L1, RORγ-t, and vacA s1/m2 would be useful to detect the clinical outcome of a patient. Our results suggested that PD-1:PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors were increased in gastric pre-cancerous lesions that progress to gastric cancer.

A total of 285 prostate adenocarcinoma cases that underwent RP between January 2009 and December 2017 and followed up for at least 3 months were included in the study. The cases were re-evaluated according to WHO-ISUP 2016 classification and the findings were recorded. The mean age was 63,4 years. Gleason scores of the cases were as follows: 3+3 144 cases (50.5%), 3+4 81 cases (28.4%), 4+3 28 cases (9.8%), 4+4 7 cases (2.5%) , 3+5 6 cases (2.1%), 5+3 2 cases (0.7%), 4+5 17 cases (6%). There were 198 (69,5%) pT2, 54 (18,9%) pT3a and 33 (11,6%) pT3b cases. The mean follow-up time was 44,1 months and BCR was detected in 97 cases (34%). The relationship between the Group Grades and BCR was statistically significant. BCR rate increased as the tumor volume and the percentage of pattern 4 increased (p<0.001).There was a significant correlation between preoperative PSA value, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin positivity, tumor volume, pattern 4 percentage, presence of cribriform glands and BCR and recurrence-free survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis and recurrence-free survival was also affected by these parameters. Among the morphological subtypes of Pattern 4, recurrence-free survival decreased as the incidence of cribriform glands increased (p <0.001). Histopathological evaluation is important in predicting BCR in prostate adenocarcinoma, the Group Grade system seems to be helpful in this regard. More studies are needed to prove the relatively worse prognostic effect of cribriform glands.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34390077,NA,NA,NA,Int J Clin Pract

A total of 6 individuals, of whom 3 are severely affected, from the family were clinically and radiologically evaluated. SNP genotyping was performed in multiple members to demonstrate genome-wide runs-of-homozygosity. Coding variants in the most likely candidate gene, HTRA1 were explored by Sanger sequencing. Published HTRA1-related phenotypes were extensively reviewed to explore the effect of number of affected alleles on phenotypic expression. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping identified a 3.2 Mbp stretch on chromosome 10q26.3 where HTRA1 gene is located. HTRA1 sequencing revealed an evolutionarily conserved novel homozygous c.824C>T (p.Pro275Leu) mutation, affecting the serine protease domain of HtrA1. Early-onset of cognitive and motor deterioration in homozygotes are in consensus with CARASIL. However, there was a clear phenotypic variability between homozygotes which includes alopecia, a suggested hallmark of CARASIL. All heterozygotes, presenting as CADASIL type 2, had spinal disk degeneration and several neuroimaging findings, including leukoencephalopathy and microhemorrhage despite a lack of severe clinical presentation. Here, we clearly demonstrate that CARASIL and CADASIL type 2 are two clinical consequences of the same disorder with different severities thorough the evaluation of the largest collection of homozygotes and heterozygotes segregating in a family. Considering the semi-dominant inheritance of HTRA1-related phenotypes, genetic testing and clinical follow-up must be offered for all members of a family with HTRA1 mutations regardless of symptoms.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34303089,NA,30,9,J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis

We aimed to compare the diagnostic efficiency of FNA and CNB performed with ultrasound guidance preoperatively for the diagnosis of parotid neoplasms. We retrospectively analysed the preoperative specimens of 113 patients (66 FNA, 47 CNB) who underwent surgical excision at our institute between 2014 and 2017. Patient selection was based on lesion type and dimension, preliminary and final pathology, imaging characteristics, clinical course, and treatment data for accurate statistical analysis. The final diagnosis was based on surgery in all of the patients. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of FNA and CNB regarding the correct tissue-specific diagnosis of benign and malignant tumours. The recurrence and complication rates were analysed to determine the safety of each technique. Among the 113 patients, the average follow-up period was 65.4 (50-88) months. Seventy-one patients (62.8%) were males, and the median age was 50 years. The most common type of surgery was superficial parotidectomy (83.2%), and the median tumour size was 30.0 mm. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most frequent neoplasm. The diagnostic rates of preoperative pathological evaluation of FNA and CNB samples were 68.2% and 91.5%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of FNA for detecting malignant lesions were 40, 100, and 100%, respectively, and those of CNB were 100, 100, and 100%, respectively. Only one complication occurred (haematoma) in the biopsy area after CNB. No recurrences were seen after CNB and FNA during the follow-up period. Our findings suggest that the diagnostic ability, sensitivity, and specificity of CNB are excellent compared with those of FNA. The only disadvantage of CNB is the need for experienced staff and good-quality equipment. The complication rates of each technique are very low, and the risk of tumour tract seeding is controversial. CNB should be considered the technique of choice when a nodule is detected in the parotid glands.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34331572,NA,NA,NA,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol

Randomly chosen 18 fertile and 18 unexplained infertile women that have 27-32 days long menstrual cycle, normal hormonal values, normal USG findings of ovary and endometrium were included. Five, six, and seven days after ovulation, endometrial biopsies were taken and prepared in accordance with light and electron microscopy tissue preparation methods. Immunohistochemical methods were used to determine MUC-1 expression in the tissues. Serum hormone levels were determined. The MUC-1 immunoreactivity, as well as the serum levels of FSH, LH, TSH, estrogen, progesterone, and total testosterone did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, prolactin levels were higher in the infertile group. In the unexplained infertile samples, intraepithelial lymphocytes were frequently observed, the microvilli of the surface columnar epithelium were widespread, cells with pinopodes as well as vesiculated cells were minimal, pinopode development was insufficient, and the development of the endometrial glands was deficient. It was concluded that these structural differences observed in the surface and glandular epithelium of the endometrium in unexplained infertile patients may be due to the insufficiency of these cells in responding to steroid hormones; therefore, these changes may affect the implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34313535,NA,NA,NA,Ultrastruct Pathol

The present study analyzed the expression of ADAMTS-1, NF-κB, and STAT3 in human pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma specimens and their correlation with glioma advancement. Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma tumor cell lines were treated with low and high doses of cytokines at 24 and 48 hours to replicate the inflammatory environment. The effects of IL-1 were assessed with the scratch wound-healing assay, and the expression levels of ADAMTS-1, NF-κB, and STAT3 of the groups were determined by western blot analysis. Cytokine treatment significantly increased the migration of PXA glioma cells after scratching at 24h and 48h timepoints. Similarly, 10 and 30 ng/mL IL-1 induced 1.86 and 1.94 fold increases, respectively, in ADAMTS-1 expression after 24h, and 3 and 3.27 fold increases, respectively, after 48h, compared with the non-treatment control group.10 and 30 ng/mL IL-1 doses caused 2.5 and 2.6 fold increase, in NF-κB protein levels after 24h, and 3.16 and 3.41 fold increases after 48h, compared with the non-treatment group. The protein levels of STAT3 after 24h were 2.62 and 2.43 fold higher, and 3.78 and 3.84 fold higher after 48 hours, with 10 and 30 ng/mL IL-1, compared with the non-treatment group. The proliferation and progression of glioma cells were proportional to the increased expression levels of ADAMTS-1, NF-κB, and STAT3.

Aging, changes in body surface area, and several cardiovascular pathologies can affect aortic root (AoR) size, thereby affecting LA anatomical shape. We hypothesized that AoR dilatation influences LAD P-A and consequently correct assessment of LA size. We tested our hypothesis in a study of 70 patients with AoR diameter ranging from 2.7 to 4.8 cm. LA size assessed in parasternal long axis view as LAD P-A was compared to that with LA width and length acquired in the apical two and four chamber view. Simpson's method of discs was used as standard measurement to assess LA volume. We observed that LAD P-A in the parasternal long axis decreases when AoR diameter increases. Thus, the increase in LA size assessed in parasternal long axis did not correlate with the increase of LA volume. Further analysis revealed that a significant positive correlation was observed when LAV was plotted as a function of LAD P-A only for those with a normal size AoR. In contrast, LA volume increase correlated with LA diameters assessed in the apical two and four chamber view regardless of AoR size. Our study documents that increases in AoR impact on the linear measurement of LA, resulting in an underestimated LAD P-A.

It was observed that lipid peroxidation (LPO), sialic acid (SA), and nitric oxide (NO) levels increased; glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase (CAT) activity, and tissue factor (TF) activity decreased significantly in the BDL group. However, in groups with BDL given BM, chard, and parsley extracts LPO, SA, NO levels decreased; GSH levels and CAT activities increased significantly. No significant differences were observed between groups in total protein, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and boron. Histological findings were supported by the biochemical results. BM, chard, and parsley extracts were effective in the regression of oxidant damage caused by cirrhosis in the brain tissues. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bitter melon (BM), chard, and parsley have antioxidant properties due to their bioactive compounds which are involved in scavenging free radicals, suppressing their production, and stimulating the production of endogenous antioxidant compounds. Since BM, chard, and parsley extracts were found to be effective in the regression of oxidant damage caused by cirrhosis in the brain tissues, these plant extracts may be an alternative in the development of different treatment approaches against brain damage in cirrhosis. At the same time, these species have been used as food by the people for many years.

We aimed to develop a TI-RADS, which is easy to apply and only relies on the counting of suspicious criteria. In order to measure the reliability of the system, we investigated its correlation with fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and post-surgery histological results. In this prospective study, 242 patients who had undergone FNAB with simultaneous cytopathologist in the radiology department between April and August 2016 were analyzed. Before FNAB, the thyroid gland was re-evaluated with US, and TI-RADS classification was made. Demographic characteristics, family thyroid cancer history and radiotherapy history to the neck region were noted. Of the 242 patients, 17.3% were male (42 males/200 females). US-guided FNAB was applied to all patients. Mean age was 50 ± 13 years (min: 19, max: 82). Both FNAB and final post-surgery histology results showed that sex and age were not statistically significantly associated with malignancy (p = 0.193) TI-RADS criteria and FNAB results revealed a statistically significant association between irregular contours, the state of anteroposterior diameter being longer than transverse diameter, microcalcifications, marked hypoechogenicity, and malignancy (p < 0,05). Thirty patients were TI-RADS ≥ 4, 206 patients were TI-RADS ≤ 3 and there was a significant correlation between TI-RADS and Bethesda classification (p = 0.001). In addition, statistically significant associations were found between malignancy and family history of thyroid cancer (p = 0.035) and radiotherapy history to the neck region (p = 0.01). TI-RADS system after nodule identification is based only on the counting of suspicious criteria. It will be safe and effective to recommend follow-up with low score TI-RADS, benign characters and insufficient FNAB results, and thus, unnecessary thyroidectomy operations will be prevented. It will be easier for surgeons to recommend surgery and persuade the patients for it when patients have high TI-RADS scores.

We studied a patient with inherited PD-1 deficiency and TB who died of pulmonary autoimmunity. The patient's leukocytes did not express PD-1 or respond to PD-1-mediated suppression. The patient's lymphocytes produced only small amounts of interferon (IFN)-γ upon mycobacterial stimuli, similarly to patients with inborn errors of IFN-γ production who are vulnerable to TB. This phenotype resulted from a combined depletion of Vδ2 +  γδ T, mucosal-associated invariant T and CD56 bright  natural killer lymphocytes and dysfunction of other T lymphocyte subsets. Moreover, the patient displayed hepatosplenomegaly and an expansion of total, activated and RORγT +  CD4 - CD8 -  double-negative αβ T cells, similar to patients with STAT3 gain-of-function mutations who display lymphoproliferative autoimmunity. This phenotype resulted from excessive amounts of STAT3-activating cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-23 produced by activated T lymphocytes and monocytes, and the STAT3-dependent expression of RORγT by activated T lymphocytes.

Further, the percentages of tumors from Black patients who had all TMA spots positive for GSTP1 (9.5%) was 3-fold higher than the percentage from White patients (3.2%; P<0.001). In terms of association with other molecular alterations, GSTP1 positivity was enriched in ERG positive cancers among Black men. By in situ hybridization, GSTP1 mRNA expression was concordant with protein staining, supporting the lack of silencing of at least some GSTP1 alleles in GSTP1-positive tumor cells. This is the first report revealing that GSTP1-positive prostate cancers are substantially over-represented among prostate cancers from Black compared to White men. This observation should prompt additional studies to determine whether GSTP1 positive cases represent a distinct molecular subtype of prostate cancer and whether GSTP1 expression could provide a biological underpinning for the observed disparate outcomes for Black men.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34191807,NA,16,6,PLoS One

It appears to represent a unique disease process with different clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics compared with late-onset colorectal cancer. Data on oncological outcomes are limited, and sensitivity to conventional neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy regimens appear to be unknown. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available literature on early-onset colorectal cancer. Within the next decade, it is estimated that 1 in 10 colon cancers and 1 in 4 rectal cancers will be diagnosed in adults younger than 50 years. Potential risk factors include a Westernized diet, obesity, antibiotic usage, and alterations in the gut microbiome. Although genetic predisposition plays a role, most cases are sporadic. The full spectrum of germline and somatic sequence variations implicated remains unknown. Younger patients typically present with descending colonic or rectal cancer, advanced disease stage, and unfavorable histopathological features. Despite being more likely to receive neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, patients with early-onset disease demonstrate comparable oncological outcomes with their older counterparts. The clinicopathological features, underlying molecular profiles, and drivers of early-onset colorectal cancer differ from those of late-onset disease. Standardized, age-specific preventive, screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies are required to optimize outcomes.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34190968,NA,NA,NA,JAMA Surg

Consequently, identification of genetic and environmental contributors to the variation in these measures in populations has become a major goal in the field. Leveraging DNA methylation and SNP data from more than 40,000 individuals, we identify 137 genome-wide significant loci, of which 113 are novel, from genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of four epigenetic clocks and epigenetic surrogate markers for granulocyte proportions and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels, respectively. We find evidence for shared genetic loci associated with the Horvath clock and expression of transcripts encoding genes linked to lipid metabolism and immune function. Notably, these loci are independent of those reported to regulate DNA methylation levels at constituent clock CpGs. A polygenic score for GrimAge acceleration showed strong associations with adiposity-related traits, educational attainment, parental longevity, and C-reactive protein levels.

In this retrospective study, we report our experience with four patients who had primary periocular apocrine adenocarcinoma initially presenting with an orbital tumor. Data extracted included demographics, clinical, imaging, and histopathological features, and treatment outcomes. The definitive diagnosis was established after an incisional biopsy in all cases. Two patients were then managed with exenteration. The third patient underwent local resection followed by radiotherapy but had to be exenterated because of new tumor formation 7 years later. The fourth patient had to be managed with oral bicalutamide which kept the tumor stable for 3 years. Recurrence-free survival for the radical surgical treatment group was 10, 6, and 7 years respectively. Periocular apocrine adenocarcinoma may insidiously develop as an orbital mass without any clinically detectable primary eyelid skin or conjunctival lesions. This tumor must be in the differential diagnosis of medially located ill-defined orbital masses in patients over 50 years of age. Orbital exenteration appeared as an effective treatment of apocrine adenocarcinoma with orbital extension.

Genetic alterations in cilia, highly-conserved organelles with sensorineural and signal transduction roles can compromise their proper functions and lead to so-called ""ciliopathies"" featuring intellectual disability (ID) or neurodevelopmental disorders as frequent clinical manifestations. Here, we report several Iranian families affected with ID and other ciliopathy-associated features carrying known and novel variants in two ciliary genes;  CEP104  and  CEP290 . Whole exome and Targeted exome sequencing were carried out on affected individuals. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from the members of affected families were established for two families carrying  CEP104  mutations.

The cases were examined according to gender, age, location and accompanying pathological diagnoses. During this period, 15 cases of ectopic adrenal tissues (6 paratubal, 3 paraovarian, 2 paratesticular, 1 spermatic cord, 1 paraaortic, 1 liver capsule, 1 omentum) were detected accompanied by two endometrial carcinomas, two serous cystadenomas, one seminoma, one mixed germ cell tumor, one bilateral ovarian serous carcinoma and hepatic high-grade colon adenocarcinoma metastasis. In this report, the fifth ectopic adrenal tissue accompanying a malignant testicular tumor, the fifth and sixth ectopic adrenal tissues occurring with ovarian serous cystadenoma, the first case observed with serous cystadenocarcinoma and the first case detected with hepatic adenocarcinoma metastasis are presented. Our cases are mostly women and adult men. Ectopic adrenal tissues can lead to hormonal problems and also to adrenal cortex and medulla neoplasms.

To this end, many approaches have been proposed to predict the partner-selecting amino acid positions in evolutionarily close complexes. These approaches can be grouped into sequence-based machine learning and structure-based energy-driven methods. In this work, we assessed these methods' ability to map the specificity-determining positions of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer progression and immune system diseases. For sequence-based predictions, we used SDPpred, Multi-RELIEF, and Sequence Harmony. For structure-based predictions, we utilized HADDOCK refinement and molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we observed that (i) sequence-based methods overpredict partner-selecting residues of Axl and that (ii) combining Multi-RELIEF with HADDOCK-based predictions provides the key Axl residues, covered by the extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Expanding on these results, we propose that a sequence-structure-based approach is necessary to determine specificity-determining positions of Axl, which can guide the development of therapeutic molecules to combat Axl misregulation.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34195226,NA,8,NA,Front Mol Biosci

Patients with cN0 laryngeal cancer who had undergone elective neck dissection together with partial or total laryngectomy between January 2006 and November 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and histopathologic predictors of occult metastasis were also analyzed. Follow-up data were used to obtain recurrence and survival analysis. A total of 86 patients with a mean age of 62.5 years were included in the study. Occult LNM was detected in 15 (17.4%) patients. Tumor grade, pT stage, thyroid cartilage invasion, and extralaryngeal extension were found to predict occult neck metastasis in univariate analysis. The mean follow-up time was 60.7 months and in the survival/recurrence analysis, pT stage, tumor location, tumor grade, presence of occult metastasis, pre-epiglottic space involvement. and extralaryngeal extension were found to predict poorer outcome. Overall occult LNM is low (17.4%) in N0 laryngeal cancer, but the presence of LNM is a poor prognostic factor. Correct determination of the neck status and proper treatment is crucial.

Totally, 12 pregnant-Wistar Albino rats were randomly divided into two groups as venom-antivenom administration (n = 6) and control groups (n = 6). In venom-antivenom administration group (VAV), the sublethal dose of A. crassicauda venom dissolved in 1 mL physiological saline solution was subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into pregnant rats during organogenesis period (between 7 and 13 days of pregnancy). Four hours after each venom injection, 1 mL/s.c. dose of the specific anti-venom was administered to rats of VAV group. The rats in control group were given sterile saline solution 1 mL/s.c. In both groups, the fetuses were surgically delivered on the 21st day of pregnancy; dams and pups were sacrificed on postnatal 21 days, and their brain tissues were removed. The brain tissue of dams and their pups were evaluated histopathologically and immunohistochemically. To show the neuronal damages, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) and amyloid beta precursor protein (ABPP) immunoexpressions were scored in cerebrum, cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata of brain. To show the neuroprotection, reelin and beta-arrestin immunoexpressions were scored again in the same way. In this context, 8-OHDG immunoexpressions were increased in neocortex, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens when compared with that of control group. Amyloid beta precursor protein was negative in both groups. Reelin and beta-arrestin partly increased in fore and mid brain of VAV group as a reaction against neuronal damages when compared with that of control pups.

To identify driver genes, chromosomal gains and losses, mutational signatures, key signaling pathways, and potential therapeutic targets, the molecular profile of 11 biliary and 6 pancreatic ITPNs, associated with invasive adenocarcinoma in 14/17 cases, are studied by whole exome sequencing (WES). The WES of 17 ITPNs reveals common copy number variants (CNVs) broadly distributed across the genome, with recurrent chromosomal deletions primarily in 1p36 and 9p21 affecting the tumor suppressors  CHD5  and  CDKN2A , respectively, and gains in 1q affecting the prominent oncogene  AKT3 . The identified somatic nucleotide variants (SNVs) involve few core signaling pathways despite high genetic heterogeneity with diverse mutational spectra: Chromatin remodeling, the cell cycle, and DNA damage/repair. An OncoKB search identifies putative actionable genomic targets in 35% of the cases (6/17), including recurrent missense mutations of the  FGFR2  gene in biliary ITPNs (2/11, 18%). Our results show that somatic SNV in classical cancer genes, typically associated with pancreato-biliary carcinogenesis, were absent ( KRAS ,  IDH1/2 ,  GNAS , and others) to rare ( TP53  and  SMAD4 , 6%, respectively) in ITPNs.

When identified at early stages, oral cancers can achieve survival rates of up to 75-90%. However, the majority of the cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage mainly due to the lack of public awareness about oral cancer signs and the delays in referrals to oral cancer specialists. As early detection and treatment remain to be the most effective measures in improving oral cancer outcomes, the development of vision-based adjunctive technologies that can detect oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), which carry a risk of cancer development, present significant opportunities for the oral cancer screening process. In this study, we explored the potential applications of computer vision techniques in the oral cancer domain within the scope of photographic images and investigated the prospects of an automated system for detecting OPMD. Exploiting the advancements in deep learning, a two-stage model was proposed to detect oral lesions with a detector network and classify the detected region into three categories (benign, OPMD, carcinoma) with a second-stage classifier network. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning-based approaches for the automated detection and classification of oral lesions in real time.

34218375,2021,7,NA,NA,"Protective effects of rutin against deltamethrin-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in rats via regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.",NA,"Deltamethrin is a type-II pyrethroid synthetic insecticide that is extensively used for controlling mosquitoes, flies, pests, and insects worldwide. This study was carried out to evaluate the likelihood protective effects of rutin, a natural antioxidant, against deltamethrin-induced liver and kidney toxicities in rats. Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were evaluated after the rats were treated orally with deltamethrin (1.28 mg/kg b.w.) alone or with rutin (25 and 50 mg/kg b.w.) for 30 days. Deltamethrin administration caused an increase in lipid peroxidation level and a decrease in activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH levels in the both tissues. Deltamethrin also increased serum ALT, AST, ALP, urea, and creatinine levels, while reduced nephrine levels in rats. In addition, deltamethrin increased the activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways by decreasing Bcl-2 and increasing TNF-α, NF-κB, IL-1β, p38α MAPK, COX-2, iNOS, beclin-1, Bax, and caspase-3 protein levels and/or activities. Furthermore, deltamethrin increased mRNA expression levels of PARP-1, VEGF, and immunohistochemical expressions of c-fos in the tissues. Rutin treatment significantly improved all examined parameters and restored the liver and kidney histopathological and immunohistochemical alterations. These findings demonstrate that rutin could be used to ameliorate hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in deltamethrin-induced rats.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34218375,NA,NA,NA,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int
34218258,2021,7,NA,NA,Interobserver variability in the assessment of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma influences the association with pathological complete response: the IVITA study.,NA,"High stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are associated with pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Histopathological assessment of sTILs in TNBC biopsies is characterized by substantial interobserver variability, but it is unknown whether this affects its association with pCR. Here, we aimed to investigate the degree of interobserver variability in an international study, and its impact on the relationship between sTILs and pCR. Forty pathologists assessed sTILs as a percentage in digitalized biopsy slides, originating from 41 TNBC patients who were treated with NAC followed by surgery. Pathological response was quantified by the MD Anderson Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated per pathologist duo and Bland-Altman plots were constructed. The relation between sTILs and pCR or RCB class was investigated. The ICCs ranged from -0.376 to 0.947 (mean: 0.659), indicating substantial interobserver variability. Nevertheless, high sTILs scores were significantly associated with pCR for 36 participants (90%), and with RCB class for eight participants (20%). Post hoc sTILs cutoffs at 20% and 40% resulted in variable associations with pCR. The sTILs in TNBC with RCB-II and RCB-III were intermediate to those of RCB-0 and RCB-I, with lowest sTILs observed in RCB-I. However, the limited number of RCB-I cases precludes any definite conclusions due to lack of power, and this observation therefore requires further investigation. In conclusion, sTILs are a robust marker for pCR at the group level. However, if sTILs are to be used to guide the NAC scheme for individual patients, the observed interobserver variability might substantially affect the chance of obtaining a pCR. Future studies should determine the 'ideal' sTILs threshold, and attempt to fine-tune the patient selection for sTILs-based de-escalation of NAC regimens. At present, there is insufficient evidence for robust and reproducible sTILs-guided therapeutic decisions.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34218258,NA,NA,NA,Mod Pathol

The study group consisted of 41 renal units (38 consecutive patients; 13 female and 25 male) surgically treated for UPJO. UPJ specimens from patients were immuno-stained with CD117 (c-kit) antibody for interstitial Cajal cells (ICCs). The relation between Cajal cell density and preoperative and postoperative radiological and scintigraphic parameters was evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 8.52 ± 8.86 (0-35) years. The density of Cajal cells was defined in 2 groups for convenient analysis as 0-5 cells (low) in 19 (46.3%) patients and >5 cells (moderate-high) in 22 (53.6%). There was significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior diameters of the related kidneys in both Cajal groups (p = 0.001-low, p = 0.000-moderate-high) independent of Cajal cell density. Regression in hydronephrosis postoperatively was determined in both Cajal groups (77.8%-low, 64.7%-moderate-high); however, there was no difference between them (p = 0.39). Preoperative T1/2 was significantly longer in the low Cajal group (p = 0.02). Postoperative T1/2 decreased in both low (p = 0.000) and moderate-high (p = 0.001) Cajal groups, but no difference was found between them (p = 0.24). There was significant improvement in the kidney differential function after surgery in the low Cajal density group (p = 0.015) while there was no correlation between the scintigraphic success or improvement and Cajal cell density (p = 0.51). ICC deficiency/density could not be shown as a predictive factor for the determination of success rate of pyeloplasty.

This survey was conducted as a retrospective cohort study. Standardized average annual mesothelioma incidence rates (AAMIRs) and mesothelioma standardized incidence ratio (mSIR) were calculated. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the importance of different factors related to mesothelioma risk. The cohort consisted of 337 people, 203 of whom were born and/or lived in Karain before immigrating to Sweden (erionite-exposed), and 134 who were born in Stockholm (erionite-unexposed). There were 69 deaths, 42 (61%) due to mesothelioma, and two patients with the disease who were still alive. Of these 44 patients, 22 were men. All mesothelioma patients were in the erionite-exposed group. In the age group 30-49 years, mesothelioma developed in 11 of 38 (29%) with erionite exposure, while there were no cases among 86 persons in the non-exposed group. For men, the AAMIR was 253.9 per 100,000 persons in the whole cohort, and for women, it was 350.9. The mSIR was 71.9 for men and 393.1 for women. Exposure to erionite exceeding 20 years and age over 40 years were associated with increased mesothelioma risk.

A 4-year retrospective study design was conducted on FNAC samples from the lymph nodes of patients in our hospital between January 2015 and December 2018. The cytopathological diagnoses were compared with the histopathological results of the same excised lymph nodes. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy rate were calculated. A total of 392 lymph nodes were aspirated during the study period. Cytologic analysis of the lymph nodes revealed the following: Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, 239 (61%); metastatic, 61 (15.6%); granulomatous lymphadenitis, 24 (6.1%); suspicious, 24 (6.1%); pyogenic abscess, 10 (2.6%); necrosis, 4 (1%); non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 2 (0.5%); and non-diagnostic, 28 (7.1%).

34220502,2021,6,NA,NA,The Protective Effects of a Combination of an Arginine Silicate Complex and Magnesium Biotinate Against UV-Induced Skin Damage in Rats.,NA,"The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of a novel combination of inositol-stabilized arginine silicate complex (ASI) and magnesium biotinate (MgB) on the prevention of skin damage after UVB exposure in rats. Forty-nine Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into one of the following groups: (1) NC, normal control, (2) SC, shaved control, (3) UVB (exposed to UVB radiation), (4) ASI+MgB-L (Low Dose), (5) ASI+MgB-H (High Dose), (6) ASI+MgB-L+MgB cream, (7) ASI+MgB-H+MgB cream. The results showed that ASI+MgB treatment alleviated the macroscopic and histopathological damages in the skin of rats caused by UVB exposure. Skin elasticity evaluation showed a similar trend. ASI+MgB increased serum Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Si, biotin, and arginine concentrations and skin hydroxyproline and biotinidase levels while decreasing skin elastase activity ( p  < 0.05) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration ( p  < 0.001). Moreover, ASI+MgB treatment increased skin levels of biotin-dependent carboxylases (ACC1, ACC2, PC, PCC, MCC) and decreased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways and matrix metalloproteinase protein levels by the regulation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1), and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways. In addition, ASI+MgB caused lower levels of inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, NFκB, IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 in the skin samples ( p  < 0.05). The levels of Bax and caspase-3 were increased, while anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased by UVB exposure, which was reversed by ASI+MgB treatment.

34228218,2021,7,NA,NA,Small cell lung cancer stem cells display mesenchymal properties and exploit immune checkpoint pathways in activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes.,NA,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor type with early dissemination and distant metastasis capacity. Even though optimal chemotherapy responses are observed initially in many patients, therapy resistance is almost inevitable. Accordingly, SCLC has been regarded as an archetype for cancer stem cell (CSC) dynamics. To determine the immune-modulatory influence of CSC in SCLC, this study focused on the characterization of CD44 + CD90 +  CSC-like subpopulations in SCLC. These cells displayed mesenchymal properties, differentiated into different lineages and further contributed to CD8 +  cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses. The interaction between CD44 + CD90 +  CSC-like cells and T cells led to the upregulation of checkpoint molecules PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG3. In the patient-derived lymph nodes, CD44 +  SCLC metastases were also observed with T cells expressing PD-1, TIM-3, or LAG3. Proliferation and IFN-γ expression capacity of TIM-3 and LAG3 co-expressing CTLs are adversely affected over long-time co-culture with CD44 + CD90 +  CSC-like cells. Moreover, especially through IFN-γ secreted by the T cells, the CSC-like SCLC cells highly expressed PD-L1 and PD-L2. Upon a second encounter with immune-experienced, IFN-γ-stimulated CSC-like SCLC cells, both cytotoxic and proliferation capacities of T cells were hampered. In conclusion, our data provide evidence for the superior potential of the SCLC cells with stem-like and mesenchymal properties to gain immune regulatory capacities and cope with cytotoxic T cell responses. With their high metastatic and immune-modulatory assets, the CSC subpopulation in SCLC may serve as a preferential target for checkpoint blockade immunotherapy .",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34228218,NA,NA,NA,Cancer Immunol Immunother

It becomes very difficult to detect the distal surgical margins (DSMs) of rectal tumors in patients who obtain clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant therapy. In this study, our aim is to examine the benefits of endoscopic tattooing of the tumor before neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer in accurate localization of the previous tumor and in providing appropriate DSMs in cases with cCR.  Patients and Methods:  The patients who were diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer, received neoadjuvant therapy and subsequently achieved cCR, and underwent surgery between January 2015 and October 2020 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they were endoscopically tattooed before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.  Results:  A total of 49 cases were included in the study. Significantly better DSMs were observed especially in female gender in the tattooed group. DSMs were found to be closer to the resection margins in the nontattooed group. It was found that endoscopic tattooing had a significant effect on the DSM in the regression analysis ( P  = .06,  R 2  = 0.47). It was determined that laparoscopy or open surgery alone did not differ in terms of DSMs but open surgery together with tattooing was found to be strongly effective in providing larger DSMs.  Conclusion:  In locally advanced rectal cancer, endoscopic tattooing of the distal margin of the tumor before neoadjuvant therapy is a reliable and effective method for obtaining a safe DSM and not leaving the residual tumor at the lower end of anastomosis, especially in cases of cCR.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34232787,NA,NA,NA,J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A

Our radiological findings confirm that the cases studied fall within the accepted biometric range of DWM. Our histopathological analysis points to reduced foliation and inferior vermian hypoplasia as common features in all examined DWM cases. We also find that the rhombic lip, a dorsal stem cell zone that drives the growth and maintenance of the posterior vermis is specifically disrupted in DWM, with reduced proliferation and self-renewal of the progenitor pool, and altered vasculature, all confirmed by transcriptomics analysis. We propose a unified model for the developmental pathogenesis of DWM. We hypothesize that rhombic lip development is disrupted through either aberrant vascularization and/or direct insult which causes reduced proliferation and failed expansion of the rhombic lip progenitor pool leading to disproportionate hypoplasia and dysplasia of the inferior vermis. Timing of insult to the developing rhombic lip (before or after 14 PCW) dictates the extent of hypoplasia and distinguishes DWM from CVH.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34347142,NA,NA,NA,Acta Neuropathol
34236295,2021,7,NA,NA,Effect of autologous growth factors on apoptosis and thickness of the outer nuclear layer in an experimental retinal degeneration model.,NA,"Retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells are a microenvironment where 90 different peptides are synthesized for transduction, visual cycle, intracellular electron transport chain, and removal of metabolic wastes. Depending on the inheritance pattern, either mutant proteins accumulate inside the cells or the energy cycle is disrupted. Disruption of homeostasis causes the cells to switch to the dormant phase; if the improper conditions last longer, then apoptosis eventually develops resulting in a loss of visual function. In neural tissues, growth factors such as neural growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and insulin-like growth factor are regulatory peptides for intracellular energy cycle and intracellular digestion. In this study, it has been shown histopathologically that autologous growth factors can prevent apoptosis and prevent loss of outer retinal thickness in the retinal degeneration model created with sodium iodate.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34236295,NA,NA,NA,Growth Factors

We hypothesized that they could be distinguished by MR imaging-based radiomic phenotypes. We retrospectively assembled T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images of 48 posterior fossa atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors and 96 match-paired medulloblastomas from 7 institutions. Using a holdout test set, we measured the performance of 6 candidate classifier models using 6 imaging features derived by sparse regression of 900 T2WI and 900 T1WI Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative-based radiomics features. From the originally extracted 1800 total Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative-based features, sparse regression consistently reduced the feature set to 1 from T1WI and 5 from T2WI. Among classifier models, logistic regression performed with the highest AUC of 0.86, with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 scores of 0.80, 0.82, 0.81, and 0.85, respectively. The top 3 important Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative features, by decreasing order of relative contribution, included voxel intensity at the 90th percentile, inverse difference moment normalized, and kurtosis-all from T2WI. Six quantitative signatures of image intensity, texture, and morphology distinguish atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors from medulloblastomas with high prediction performance across different machine learning strategies. Use of this technique for preoperative diagnosis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors could significantly inform therapeutic strategies and patient care discussions.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34266866,NA,NA,NA,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol

Milrinone, which is known to have a modulatory effect on proinflammatory cytokines, was administered to the designated groups in the early period before severe sepsis developed. It was aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of milrinone on the lung and kidney tissues of rats in the late phase of sepsis. Seven groups; with six animals in each group: healthy, CLP-S12 (sacrificed at hour 12), CLP-S24 (sacrificed at hour 24), CLP-MIL1-S12 (administered with 0.5 mg/kg milrinone at hour 1 and sacrificed at hour 12), CLP-MIL1-S24 (administered with 0.5 mg/kg milrinone at hour 1 and sacrificed at hour 24), CLP-MIL12-S24 (administered with 0.5 mg/kg milrinone at hour 12 and sacrificed at hour 24), and CLP-MIL1,12-S24 (administered with 0.5 mg/kg milrinone at hours 1 and 12 and sacrificed at hour 24). Significant differences were found between the early and late administration of milrinone in terms of both molecular and histopathological results. The results showed that the tissues were significantly preserved in the groups in which milrinone had been started in the early period compared to the sepsis control groups and the groups in which milrinone had been started in the late period. In addition to positive inotropic effects of the milrinone, its immunomodulatory properties that result in decreased cytokine storm can be beneficial during early period of sepsis.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34242458,NA,NA,NA,Pediatr Int

The expression levels of calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) permeable TRPV1 channels are high in the dorsal root ganglion (DRGs) and hippocampus (HIPPO). TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin and reactive free oxygen radicals (fROS) to mediate peripheral neuropathy and neurotoxicity. Noopept (NP) acted several protective antioxidant actions against oxidative neurotoxicity. As DM is known to increase the levels of fROS, the protective roles of antioxidant NP were evaluated on the DM-mediated neurotoxicity and neuropathic pain via the modulation of TRPV1 in rats. Thirty-six rats were equally divided into control, NP, DM (streptozotocin, STZ), and STZ + NP groups. A decrease on the STZ-mediated increase of neuropathic pain (via the analyses of Von Frey and hot plate) and blood glucose level was observed by the treatment of NP. A protective role of NP via downregulation of TRPV1 activity on the STZ-induced increase of apoptosis, mitochondrial fROS, lipid peroxidation, caspase -3 (CASP-3), caspase -9 (CASP-9), TRPV1 current density, glutathione (GSH), cytosolic free Zn 2+ , and Ca 2+  concentrations in the DRGs and HIPPO was also observed. The STZ-mediated decrease of glutathione peroxidase, GSH, vitamin E, and β-carotene concentrations in the brain cortex, erythrocyte, liver, kidney, and plasma was also attenuated by the treatment of NP. The STZ-mediated increase of TRPV1, CASP-3, and CASP-9 expressions was decreased in the DRGs and HIPPO by the treatment of NP. In conclusion, the treatment of NP induced protective effects against STZ-induced adverse peripheral pain and HIPPO oxidative neurotoxicity.

In recent years, vitamin D deficiency appeared as a worldwide problem, affecting many people in different ways including the Northern Cypriot population. The deficiency might be caused by the lack of exposure to sunlight, diet low in vitamin D, sedentary lifestyle, and also due to some genetic variations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. In this study, four common VDR polymorphisms and associations with vitamin D deficiency in the Turkish Cypriot population between ages 18-40 and working in office conditions was studied by PCR- RFLP analysis. rs2228570 C>T variant was shown to be significantly associated with low serum vitamin D levels in the studied population.

A 50 mg/kg dose of taxifolin was administered via oral gavage to the taxifolin + acrylamide (TACR) group (n-6) consisting of male albino Wistar rats. The same volume of distilled water used as solvent was orally administered to the acrylamide (ACR) (n-6) and healthy (HG) (n-6) groups. One hour after the administration of taxifolin and distilled water, a 20 mg/kg dose of acrylamide was orally administered to the TACR and ACR groups.

In the acrylamide group, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels were found to be high, total glutathione (tGSH) levels were found to be low, and there was severe interstitial haemorrhage; additionally, tubular necrosis, tubular atrophy, leucocyte infiltration, and glomerular structures with expanded Bowman's space were observed. In the taxifolin group, where the increase of MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α and the decrease of tGSH associated with acrylamide have been prevented, any histopathological finding other than mild necrosis and atrophic tubules was not found.

Recent evidence indicates that distinct epigenomic landscapes underlie PDAC progression, identifying the H3K9me pathway as important to its pathobiology. Here, we delineate the role of Euchromatic Histone-lysine  N -Methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), the enzyme that generates H3K9me, as a downstream effector of oncogenic KRAS during PDAC initiation and pancreatitis-associated promotion.  EHMT2  inactivation in pancreatic cells reduces H3K9me2 and antagonizes Kras  G 12 D  -mediated acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN) formation in both the  Pdx1-Cre  and  P48   Cre/+   Kras   G 12 D  mouse models.  Ex vivo  acinar explants also show impaired EGFR-KRAS-MAPK pathway-mediated ADM upon  EHMT2  deletion. Notably, Kras  G 12 D  increases EHMT2 protein levels and EHMT2-EHMT1-WIZ complex formation. Transcriptome analysis reveals that  EHMT2  inactivation upregulates a cell cycle inhibitory gene expression network that converges on the  Cdkn1a/p21-Chek2  pathway. Congruently, pancreas tissue from  Kras   G 12 D  animals with  EHMT2  inactivation have increased P21 protein levels and enhanced senescence. Furthermore, loss of  EHMT2  reduces inflammatory cell infiltration typically induced during Kras  G 12 D  -mediated initiation. The inhibitory effect on Kras  G 12 D  -induced growth is maintained in the pancreatitis-accelerated model, while simultaneously modifying immunoregulatory gene networks that also contribute to carcinogenesis. This study outlines the existence of a novel KRAS-EHMT2 pathway that is critical for mediating the growth-promoting and immunoregulatory effects of this oncogene  in vivo , extending human observations to support a pathophysiological role for the H3K9me pathway in PDAC.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34249932,NA,9,NA,Front Cell Dev Biol

With the advent of targeted therapies for ARCAs, disease registries have become a precious source of real-world quantitative and qualitative data complementing knowledge from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Here, we review the  ARCA Registry , a global collaborative multicenter platform (>15 countries, >30 sites) with the overarching goal to advance trial readiness in ARCAs. It presents a good clinical practice (GCP)- and general data protection regulation (GDPR)-compliant professional-reported registry for multicenter web-based capture of cross-center standardized longitudinal data. Modular electronic case report forms (eCRFs) with core, extended, and optional datasets allow data capture tailored to the participating site's variable interests and resources. The eCRFs cover all key data elements required by regulatory authorities [European Medicines Agency (EMA)] and the European Rare Disease (ERD) platform. They capture genotype, phenotype, and progression and include demographic data, biomarkers, comorbidity, medication, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and longitudinal clinician- or patient-reported ratings of ataxia severity, non-ataxia features, disease stage, activities of daily living, and (mental) health status. Moreover, they are aligned to major autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and sporadic ataxia (SPORTAX) registries in the field, thus allowing for joint and comparative analyses not only across ARCAs but also with SCAs and sporadic ataxias. The registry is at the core of a systematic multi-component ARCA database cluster with a linked biobank and an evolving study database for digital outcome measures. Currently, the registry contains more than 800 patients with almost 1,500 visits representing all ages and disease stages; 65% of patients with established genetic diagnoses capture all the main ARCA genes, and 35% with unsolved diagnoses are targets for advanced next-generation sequencing.

To determine pathological changes in BD skin lesions related to the complex genetic predisposition METHODS: We characterised the expression of IL-17A and IL-23A in various cell types by immunohistological double staining of sections from papulopustular skin lesions (PPL) of acute attacks of BD and lesions of psoriasis vulgaris (PV), another HLA-class I-associated T-cell mediated autoimmune disease in which excessive T-cell derived IL-17A production promotes neutrophil activation. We found that in BD lesions, as in psoriasis, actively expanding CD8 +  T cells were the predominant source of IL-17A. IL-17A +  CD8 +  T (Tc17) cells outnumbered infiltrating IL-17A +  CD4 +  T cells. Unlike the epidermal localisation of CD8 +  T cells in psoriasis, Tc17 cells in BD lesions infiltrated mainly the perivascular tissue and also the blood vessel walls of dermis and subcutaneous tissue. They colocalised with a marked IL-23A expression by CD11c +  dendritic cells (DCs) and CD68 +  macrophages. IL-17A expression was associated with extensive recruitment of neutrophils around blood vessels that formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In BD, the genetic predisposition may mediate antigen-specific activation and differentiation of a T c  17 response, possibly targeting endothelial antigens. Neutrophils recruited by IL-17A in this process may enhance tissue damage by extensive NET formation (NETosis). Thus, the IL-23/IL-17 axis presumably controls neutrophilic inflammation in BD vasculitis in the context of a predominant antigen-specific CD8 +  T-cell response.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34254298,NA,NA,NA,Br J Dermatol

Complement system plays a key role in immune responses from host to graft. It was demonstrated that complement system activation is related with renal fibrosis. We evaluate clinical impact of complement deposition findings on biopsies in acute rejection episodes of pediatric renal transplant patients. Demographics of the patients, graft functions, acute rejection episodes and graft loss were recorded from data files of 165 pediatric renal transplant patients. Findings of 98 renal biopsies were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty three patients with kidney transplant had 44 acute rejection episodes (32 pure cellular acute rejection episodes / 1 pure humoral acute rejection episode / 11 combined acute cellular and acute humoral rejection episodes) proven by biopsy. C1q staining was positive in 7 biopsies, C3 staining in 15 biopsies and, C4d staining in 15 biopsies. 26 patients had graft fibrosis. All patients with a rejection history had a significant decrease in GFR value during follow-up. Patients who did not have fibrotic changes in first biopsy had same level of deterioration of GFR when compared with patients who had fibrotic changes in first biopsy. We could not demonstrate a significant relation between complement deposition and renal fibrosis, and between complement deposition and GFR values.

We prospectively collected minimum 0.5cm parts of fresh frozen tumor samples from patients with bladder tumor between 2015 and 2017. Primary bladder cancer cultures were produced from the frozen tumor samples. Two different doses of ABS were used on cancer cell cultures. Viability of each cases were performed. Flow-cytometry were used for determination of apoptosis and necroptosis. We also checked the effect of ABS on different stages, grade and variant histology of bladder cancer cells. The results of all cases were compared with their own controls. This study included 24 bladder cancer cases. Mean age of patients was 66.2±11.7years (34-83years); where 19 of them (79.5%) were male and 5 (20.5%) were female. When we compared the data, we found decreased cancer cell viability ratio in each ABS group compared to their own controls. Necroptosis was observed in the great majority of ABS groups, and necroptosis and apoptosis were observed in some cases. In this present study we demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of ABS on bladder cancer cells. The results of this study suggests planning of animal model of bladder cancer for ABS with intravesical application as an antineoplastic agent.

We explore the unique characteristics of both of these probes as they relate to intraoperative laryngeal nerve mapping. Twenty-one patients undergoing neuromonitored thyroidectomy by a single surgeon were enrolled. Electromyography (EMG) amplitude and latency measurements were prospectively recorded concurrently from 1 mA stimulation of vagus nerve (VN) and inferior/superior recurrent laryngeal nerve before (with and without fascia) and after thyroid resection using bipolar and monopolar stimulator probes. Significantly higher amplitudes were obtained with monopolar stimulator probes as compared to bipolar probes, in several stimulation scenarios such as at right VN pre-resection (carotid sheath intact), right VN pre-resection (carotid sheath dissected), right VN post-resection and left VN (carotid sheath dissected). No significant differences were found between amplitudes and latency values in all other stimulation scenarios. According to this study, both probes are reliable and safe for neural mapping.

The review is aimed at presenting an insight into the botanical features and geographical distribution of  Peganum  spp. along with traditional folk uses. This manuscript also reviews the phytochemical profile of  Peganum  spp. and its correlation with biological activities evidenced by the  in vitro  and  in vivo  investigations. Moreover, this review gives us an understanding of the bioactive compounds from  Peganum  as health promoters followed by the safety and adverse effects on human health. In relation to their multipurpose therapeutic properties, various parts of this plant such as seeds, bark, and roots present bioactive compounds promoting health benefits. An updated search (until December 2020) was carried out in databases such as PubMed and ScienceDirect.

In pathological conditions, it is involved in many tumors such as giant cell bone tumor (osteoclastoma), aneurysmal bone cyst, osteosarcoma, and metastatic cancers, and it usually causes local spread and progression of the tumor, working against the host. Since osteoclasts play an active role in primary bone tumors and bone metastases, the use of anti-osteoclastic agents significantly reduces the mortality and morbidity rates of patients by preventing the progression and local spread of tumors. Osteoclasts also accompany undifferentiated carcinomas of many organs, especially pancreas, thyroid, bladder and ovary. Undifferentiated carcinomas rich in osteoclasts have osteoclastoma-like histology. In these organs, osteoclastoma-like histology may accompany epithelial carcinomas, and  de novo , benign and borderline tumors. Mature and immature myeloid cells, including osteoclasts, play an active role in the tumor progression in primary and metastatic tumor microenvironment, in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mesenchymal-epithelial-transition (MET), and cancer stem cell formation. Additionally, they are the most suitable candidates for cancer cells in cell fusion due to their evolutionary fusion capabilities. Myeloid features and markers (CD163, CD33, CD68 etc.) can be seen in metastatic cancer cells. Consequently, they provide metastatic cancer cells with motility, margination, transmigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, angiogenesis, matrix degradation, and resistance to chemotherapy. For these reasons, we think that the concept of Epithelial-Mesencyhmal-Myeloid-Transition (EMMT) will be more accurate than EMT for cancer cells with myeloid properties.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34257573,NA,27,NA,Pathol Oncol Res

Evaluating the metastatic nature of the SPNs detected in the thorax computed tomography (TCT) examination for staging purposes in cancer patients becomes a fundamental problem for the physician. Invasive procedures, additional imaging or follow-up imaging, are often used to differentiate metastatic and non-metastatic nodules. In this study, we aimed to distinguish SPNs detected in patients diagnosed with bladder cancer (BC) as metastatic and non-metastatic nodules by texture analysis. TCT images of patients diagnosed with BC in our hospital from January 2007 until December 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. A total of 46 patients with SPN, including metastatic (n= 19) and non-metastatic (n= 27), were included in the study. Short axis diameter, long-axis diameter, nodule volume and volume histogram values of the nodules were obtained. Chisquare test was used to evaluate dependent variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate independent variables. ROC curves of the obtained data were plotted. Statistically, the significant p-value was determined as less than 0.05. A significant difference was found between SPN long axis, short axis and volume values. In the volumetric histogram analysis, the maximum density value and the mean density value were found to be statistically significant. When the average of the highest densities in the volume histogram data was evaluated, the area under the curve value was 0.702 (95% CI, 519-854). The metastatic nodule could be distinguished with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 70% when the volume histogram has the maximum density threshold of 50 HU.

Serum levels of KIM-1, NGAL, and aldose reductase in RIPC + PN, PN and RIPC groups were significantly lower than that of sham group. Tissue biomarker levels were similar across groups. The observed trend in mean necrosis area of PN group was higher than that of RIPC + PN group (p > 0.05). The transitional zone between necrosis and healthy tissue showed a trend towards increasing width in the rats subjected to RIPC before PN vs. those who underwent PN without RIPC (p > 0.05). RIPC failed to counteract the renal functional consequences of PN under warm ischemia in a solitary kidney animal model.

Statistical analysis of the possible relationships among the mutation carrier status of the patients and the parameters of gender, age at diagnosis, and family cancer history, were performed. The mean age at diagnosis of all CRC patients was 48.7 years (range 28-74). Mutations in MLH1, MSH6, CHEK2, PMS2 and MUTYH genes were detected in 10 patients (24.4%). The mean age at diagnosis of CRC was 46.2 years in those who carried the mutation, while it was 49.5 years in those without. Carriers and non-mutation carriers, when compared in terms of age at diagnosis, gender, family cancer history, no significant difference was observed. Genes that may cause susceptibility to cancer may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of the CRC.

The data of 208 patients, who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2012-2018, were retrospectively analyzed. The surgical margin status of 147 pathologically organ-confined patients was categorized as positive, close ( < 1mm) and negative. Surgical margin status and parameters affecting biochemical recurrence were examined. Furthermore, multivariate analysis was done to determine the parameters associated with biochemical recurrence. Biochemical recurrence was detected in 21 (14.2%) of 147 patients. 38 (27.9%) men had negative surgical margins, 68 (46.2%) had close surgical margins and 41 (25.9%) had positive surgical margins. Tumor volume and ISUP grade were found to be statistically significant for positive surgical margin and close surgical margin patients compared to negative surgical margin patients. Close surgical margin was not statistically associated with biochemical recurrence. Preoperative high PSA (p < 0.001) and positive surgical margin (p=0.021) were independent risk factors for biochemical recurrence.

Although morphology and immunohistochemistry are quite helpful for diagnosing these tumors, many require molecular tests. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization has been the most commonly used method for the detection of specific genomic alteration, but next generation sequencing (NGS) could be more informative in many ways. Here we present our targeted NGS experience on soft tissue tumors with a series of 20 cases. The Laboratory Information System (LIS) was screened for soft tissue tumors that had been sequenced by NGS (between January 2018 - February 2021). 20 consecutive cases were included in the study. All cases were sequenced using a commercial targeted sequencing panel designed for soft tissue tumors. We were able to run a reliable sequencing study for 16 (80%) of the cases but 4 (20%) of them failed in quality tests. We have found pathogenic alterations in 12 (60%) of the cases. The most common alterations were EWSR1 fusions, FLI1 being the most common partner. NGS results drastically changed the initial diagnosis, and thus the treatment modalities, in 3 cases (15%): the case with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion, the case with FUS-TFCP2 fusion, and the case of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that was favored to be of the alveolar subtype and turned out to lack FOXO1 fusions.

Our aim in this study was to document the clinicopathological findings in patients with gastric metastases and find out if there are any potentially significant features to be used in the differential diagnosis. Our cohort consisted of 17 histologically verified gastric metastasis cases. Clinical, endoscopic and microscopic features were retrospectively analyzed. The primary sites were the breast, skin, lungs, ovaries, colon, and gluteal soft tissue. Three patients were symptomatic because of the metastatic involvement of the stomach and 9 patients had concomitant metastasis in other sites. Invasive lobular breast carcinoma and malignant melanoma were the most common metastatic malignancies. The most common macroscopic appearance was the diffuse infiltrative type (Borrmann Type 4). Most of the metastatic lesions endoscopically mimicked primary gastric cancer. Furthermore, some of the metastatic lesions, particularly invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and malignant melanoma, displayed histopathologic features similar to the primary gastric malignancies to a certain extent. The possibility of metastatic involvement of stomach must be kept in mind while dealing with a gastric mass lesion in a cancer patient, even though the clinical and endoscopic features suggest primary gastric cancer.

Previously, we have shown that increasing the tissue endocannabinoid levels by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacyl glycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors can prevent airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. In the present study, the changes in the levels of major metabolites of endocannabinoids by systemic and local FAAH or MAGL inhibitor treatments were evaluated. Mice were treated with either FAAH inhibitor URB597 or MAGL inhibitor JZL184 by local (intranasal) or systemic (intraperitoneal) application. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and lungs were isolated afterwards in order to perform histopathological and metabolomic analysis. There were no significant histopathological changes in the lungs and neutrophil, macrophage and lymphocyte numbers in BAL fluid were not altered after local and systemic treatments. However, GC-MS based metabolomics profile allowed to identify 102 metabolites in lung samples in which levels of 75 of them were significantly different from the control. The metabolites whose levels are changed by treatments were mostly related with the endocannabinoid system and energy metabolism. Therefore, these changes may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of URB597 and JZL184 treatments in mice.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34449902,NA,NA,NA,Biomed Chromatogr

In this retrospective comparative case study, we identified the cases of polymicrobial keratitis from the microbiological records (n = 649) at Balcalı Hospital, Çukurova University (Adana, Turkey; October 2010-2018). We included all the cases of infectious keratitis with two different types of microbial agents and grouped them as follows: group 1 (n = 25), bacterium-fungus coexistence; group 2 (n = 12), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Acanthamoeba with bacterial infection; and group 3 (n = 7), HSV or Acanthamoeba with fungal infection. We compared the clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes among the groups. In our study, we found that 44 infectious keratitis cases (6.7%) were of polymicrobial nature. The mean follow-up period was 11.4 ± 17.8 months. In total, 17 different bacteria along with 3 different fungi, HSV, and Acanthamoeba were isolated. The most common bacterium was Staphylococcus epidermidis (25%). Most of the fungal pathogens were filamentous. Patients with initial treatment failure and requiring surgical intervention had larger infiltrates (p = 0.023, p = 0.003, respectively) than other patients. Older age was associated with delayed recovery and poor visual prognosis. Bacterial-fungus coexistence is the most common combination among patients, but other combinations should also be considered for suspected polymicrobial etiology.

The objects were divided into two groups. Group 1; adenoidectomy with chronic serous otitis media, group 2; adenoidectomy without chronic serous otitis media. Serum and tissue thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels were measured by ELISA. Serum and tissue TLSP levels, mast cell count, adenoid size were compared between the groups. Twenty-four (60%) of patients were female and 16 (40%) were male. Twenty patients (55%) had adenoid hypertrophy with chronic serous otitis media, and 18 (45%) had adenoid hypertrophy without chronic serous otitis media. The mean age of the patients was 6.21 ± 2.31 years. The mean mast cell count was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (p = 0.017). The mean tissue thymic stromal lymphopoietin measurement was also significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 (p = 0.023). However, there was no significant difference in regards to serum levels between the groups (p = 0.480). The number of mast cells as well as thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels in the adenoids of children was significantly high in the chronic serous otitis media patients. The release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin from the adenoid tissue plays a role in initiating and maintaining a local inflammatory reaction in the eustachian tube that may lead eventually to middle ear effusion in non-atopic patients.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34279733,NA,NA,NA,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol

This study aimed to compare the characteristics of plasma exosomes of DLBCL patients and healthy individuals and to evaluate the exosomal interactions between DLBCL cell lines and normal B-cells. Exosome isolation was performed using an ultracentrifugation-based protocol from plasma of 20 patients with DLBCL and 20 controls. The expression of miRNAs from exosome samples was analyzed using a miRNA expression microarray. The presence of exosome-mediated communication between the lymphoma cells and normal B-cells was determined by the co-culture model. A significant increase in plasma exosome concentrations of DLBCL patients was observed. There was also a significant decrease in the expression of 33 miRNAs in plasma exosomes of DLBCL patients. It was determined that normal B-cells internalize DLBCL-derived exosomes and then miRNA expression differences observed in normal B-cells are specific to lymphoma-subtypes. MiR-3960, miR-6089 and miR-939-5p can be used as the miRNA signature in DLBCL diagnosis.

The aim of this study is to reveal whether the signal intensity in T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging can predict postoperative results in acromegaly patients with macroadenoma. We analyzed our surgical results in regard to T2-weighted images in newly diagnosed consecutive 124 patients with acromegaly, operated between 2014 and 2019. The T2-intensity of the pure somatotroph macroadenomas was correlated with the clinical, radiological, surgical and histopathological characteristics of the acromegaly patients. We found a predominance of T2-hyperintensity in our series (45%) and the T2-hypointense pure somatotroph adenomas were detected in only 34% of our patients. Total resection was performed in 72% of newly diagnosed acromegaly patients in this series. Accordingly, total resection was achieved in 69% of the T2-hyperintense group, 77% of the T2-hypointense group and 69% of the T2-isointense group. The surgical remission rates for the T2-hyper-, hypo- and isointense groups were 54.5%, 80.7%, and 68.7%, respectively. The surgical remission rate in the T2-hyperintense group was significantly lower than those of hypo- and isointense groups in newly diagnosed acromegaly patients. This study demonstrates a close relationship between the T2 signal intensity and the surgical remission rates in acromegaly patients with macroadenoma. Preoperative T2-intensity images may predict the probability of post-surgical remission in patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly. Further support fort this idea comes from recent guidelines for acromegaly management in which the potential utility of using T2 intensity to optimize patient management has been emphasized.",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34275532,NA,90,NA,J Clin Neurosci

Fifty-six patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor were included. The associations between clinicopathological parameters and prognosis were evaluated statistically. Efficiencies of different thresholds for tumor size, mitotic count, and Ki67 proliferation index for prognosis prediction were compared. Vascular invasion was statistically associated with high tumor grade, advanced pT stage, and mortality rate. The presence of non-functional tumor, lymphatic invasion, and > 10 cm tumor size were significantly related to shorter overall survival. Advanced pT stage (pT3-4), > 5 cm tumor size, and high tumor grade (grades 2-3) were significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival. The mortality rate showed the strongest statistical significance with mitotic count when grouped as 1: < 2, 2: 2-10, and 3: > 10 mitosis/ 2 mm 2 . The 10% threshold value for Ki67 index was more successful in predicting adverse prognosis.

Epithelial TAMs counts were higher in patients with nonendometrioid carcinomas (P=0.0001) and cases with recurrence (P=0.018). High stromal TAMs counts were associated with deeper myometrial invasion (P=0.017) and the presence of distant metastasis (P=0.024). The counts of margin TAMs was significantly correlated with the depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, FIGO stage, lymph node metastases, distant metastasis, and recurrence (P=0.0001, 0.0001, 0.004, 0.005, 0.014, and 0.04, respectively). CD47 expression was not associated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. However, high epithelial and stromal TAM counts were associated with shorter OS. Besides, high epithelial and margin TAM counts were associated with shorter progression-free survival. Furthermore, increased stromal and margin TAM counts were determined to be an independent prognostic marker of reduced OS. TAM count is, therefore, a significant prognostic factor in EC and the CD47 assessment has potential benefit for future clinical use.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34282107,NA,NA,NA,Int J Gynecol Pathol

This study evaluates whether adding hydrogen sulfide donor AP39 to Hemopure, a blood substitute, during subnormothermic perfusion improves kidney outcomes. After 30 min of renal pedicle clamping, porcine kidneys were treated to 4 h of static cold storage (SCS-4 °C) or subnormothermic perfusion at 21 °C with Hemopure (H-21 °C), Hemopure + 200 nM AP39 (H200nM-21 °C) or Hemopure + 1 µM AP39 (H1µM-21 °C). Then, kidneys were reperfused with Hemopure at 37 °C for 4 h with metabolic support. Perfusate composition, tissue oxygenation, urinalysis and histopathology were analyzed. During preservation, the H200nM-21 °C group exhibited significantly higher urine output than the other groups and significantly higher tissue oxygenation than the H1µM-21 °C group at 1 h and 2h. During reperfusion, the H200nM-21 °C group exhibited significantly higher urine output and lower urine protein than the other groups. Additionally, the H200nM-21 °C group exhibited higher perfusate pO 2  levels than the other groups and significantly lower apoptotic injury than the H-21 °C and the H1µM-21 °C groups. Thus, subnormothermic perfusion at 21 °C with Hemopure + 200 nM AP39 improves renal outcomes. Additionally, our novel blood-free model of ex vivo kidney preservation and reperfusion could be useful for studying other therapeutics.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34281230,NA,22,13,Int J Mol Sci

The effectiveness of tyrosol, a natural phenolic compound, was examined in the asthma model induced by ovalbumin (OVA). For this purpose, four groups, each consisting of eight rats, were arranged. For 21 days, physiological saline solution was treated to the control group and OVA was treated to the groups of OVA, OVA + dexamethasone (Dexa) and OVA + tyrosol groups, intraperitoneally and through inhalation. Additionally, 0.25 mg/kg Dexa was treated to the OVA + Dexa group and 20 mg/kg tyrosol to the OVA + tyrosol group by oral gavage. Serum, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues of the rats were examined. It was observed that MDA level decreased, GSH level and GPx activity increased, and there was no change in CAT activity in lung tissues of the tyrosol treatment groups. It was also observed that NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ and IgE levels decreased compared to the OVA group in lung tissue and serum samples except for serum NF-κB and IL-4. However, no effect on IL-1 β level was observed. In addition, it was determined that tyrosol treatment increased the IL-10 level on both tissue samples. The results of the histopathological investigation of lung tissue showed that tyrosol significantly ameliorated OVA-induced histopathological lesions. Additionally, PAS staining showed that mucus hypersecretion was significantly reduced with the use of tyrosol. In addition, it was determined that the number of eosinophils decreased significantly in blood and BALF samples. The obtained results showed that tyrosol possessed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory features on OVA-induced rats and preserved tissue architecture.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34287677,NA,NA,NA,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol

Different prognostic factors are the subject of research to differentiate the prognosis even between cases at a similar stage and identify risky patients earlier and create individual treatment approaches. Tumor budding (TB) has been identified as a poor prognostic factor in many types of cancer, especially colorectal carcinomas. In our study, we aimed to determine the prognostic significance of the TB by evaluating the TB in line with clinicopathological parameters in breast invasive ductal carcinoma cases. 311 breast carcinoma cases operated in our hospital between January 2010 and April 2020 were included in the study. In hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) sections of the cases, TB was evaluated in a single high-power field (HPF). ROC analysis was performed with overall survival data, and low, and high TB cutoffs were obtained. The relationship of the high TB with clinicopathological parameters was evaluated, and survival analysis was performed. We determined that high TB in breast invasive ductal carcinoma cases was associated with low survival time, metastasis, axillary lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, advanced stage (pT3), high Ki-67 proliferation index, progesterone receptor (PR) loss, and advanced age. Tumor budding was identified as an independent risk factor in overall and disease-free survival analysis. Tumor budding is a prognostic parameter that can be easily evaluated in all centers since it does not cause additional cost to routine pathological examinations. We think it may be helpful to establish a standard methodology in evaluating tumor bud in breast carcinomas and including it in regular pathology reporting.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34293708,NA,54,NA,Ann Diagn Pathol

This raises the question: why not use clamping in orthopaedic, oncological, fracture and revision surgeries of areas where tourniquets are not suitable. This experimental animal study aimed to compare tourniquet and arterial clamp applications with regard to their histological effects and inflammatory responses on a molecular level, on the artery, vein, nerve and muscle tissue. Twenty-one rabbits were divided into three groups (group I: proximal femoral artery clamp; group II: proximal thigh tourniquet; and group III: control group). In the clamp group, the common femoral artery was clamped with a microvascular clamp for two hours. In the tourniquet group, a 12-inch cuff was applied to the proximal thigh for two hours at 200 mmHg. The common femoral artery, vein, nerve, rectus femoris and tibialis anterior muscles were excised and analysed in all groups. Artery and vein endothelial injuries were found in the clamp and tourniquet groups (relative to the control group,  p  ≤ 0.001 and  p  = 0.007, respectively). However, no difference was found between the clamp and tourniquet groups regarding vessel wall injury. We found there were no differences in incidence of vessel, muscle and nerve injury when comparing the tourniquet and clamp applications. For surgical procedures that are unsuited to a tourniquet, arterial clamping can be selected, resulting in close-to-tourniquet vessel injury rates but without tourniquet-related complications.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34292289,NA,32,NA,Cardiovasc J Afr

A contemporary assessment of their in vitro potency against a global CR-PA collection and an assessment of carbapenemase diversity are warranted. Isolates determined as CR-PA by the submitting site were collected from 2019-2021 (17 centers in 12 countries) during the ERACE-PA Global Surveillance Program. Broth microdilution MICs were assessed per CLSI standards for ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, ceftazidime, and cefepime. Phenotypic carbapenemase testing was conducted (modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM)). mCIM positive isolates underwent genotypic carbapenemase testing using the CarbaR, the CarbaR NxG, or whole genome sequencing. The MIC 50/90  was reported as well as percent susceptible (CLSI and EUCAST interpretation). Of the 807 isolates, 265 (33%) tested carbapenemase-positive phenotypically. Of these, 228 (86%) were genotypically positive for a carbapenemase with the most common being VIM followed by GES. In the entire cohort of CR-PA, ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam had MIC 50/90  values of 2/ > 64 and 4/64 mg/L, respectively. Ceftazidime/avibactam was the most active agent with 72% susceptibility per CLSI compared with 63% for ceftolozane/tazobactam. For comparison, 46% of CR-PA were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefepime. Against carbapenemase-negative isolates, 88 and 91% of isolates were susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam, respectively. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam remained highly active against carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, particularly in the absence of carbapenemases.

Canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed in all patients. The differential staining properties--positive staining in the cholesteatoma and negative staining in the skin tissue (C+S-), negative staining in the cholesteatoma and positive staining in the skin tissue(C-S+)--were compared for bone erosion scores (BES), stage, and recurrence rates. Isolated findings in the cholesteatoma tissues, without matching with the skin tissues, demonstrated that stage and recurrence rates were not related to findings in the cholesteatoma tissues (P > .05). However, C+S- for Ki-67 and C-S+ for p27 are risk factors for worse prognosis including advanced stage (P < .001 for Ki-67 and P = .008 for p27), BES values (P < .001 for Ki-67 and P = .001 for p27), and recurrence rates (P < .001 for Ki-67 and P = .037 for p27).

34307543,NA,NA,NA,NA,Molecular pathways in viral hepatitis-associated liver carcinogenesis: An update.,NA,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of cancer among primary malignant tumors of the liver and is a consequential cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In recent years, uncovering the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and behavior of this tumor has led to the identification of multiple potential treatment targets. Despite the vast amount of data on this topic, HCC remains a challenging tumor to treat due to its aggressive behavior and complex molecular profile. Therefore, the number of studies aiming to elucidate the mechanisms involved in both carcinogenesis and tumor progression in HCC continues to increase. In this context, the close association of HCC with viral hepatitis has led to numerous studies focusing on the direct or indirect involvement of viruses in the mechanisms contributing to tumor development and behavior. In line with these efforts, this review was undertaken to highlight the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) participate in oncogenesis and tumor progression in HCC and summarize new findings. Cumulative evidence indicates that HBV DNA integration promotes genomic instability, resulting in the overexpression of genes related to cancer development, metastasis, and angiogenesis or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In addition, genetic variations in HBV itself, especially preS2 deletions, may play a role in malignant transformation. Epigenetic dysregulation caused by both viruses might also contribute to tumor formation and metastasis by modifying the methylation of DNA and histones or altering the expression of microRNAs. Similarly, viral proteins of both HBV and HCV can affect pathways that are important anticancer targets.

Additional, comprehensive studies are also needed to determine these viruses' interaction with integrins, farnesoid X, and the apelin system in malignant transformation and tumor progression.

Methods   A total of 1,042 pituitary adenomas were included in the study and 101 of them were diagnosed as atypical adenoma. Demographic characteristics, radiological evaluations, and clinical information were obtained from a computer-based patient database. Cases were categorized as atypical or typical using the criteria listed in 2004 Classification of Tumors of Endocrine Organs.  Results   The cure and reoperation rates did not show any statistically significant difference between the typical and atypical adenomas. However, a higher K  i  -67 labeling index was found to be associated with a higher rate of reoperation (  p   = 0.008) in atypical adenomas. Of note, cavernous sinus invasion or parasellar extension was found to be associated with lower cure rates in patients with atypical pituitary adenomas (  p   < 0.001 and  p   = 0.001, respectively).  Conclusion   Although atypical pituitary adenomas are known to be more invasive, this study demonstrated that the reoperation and cure rates are the same for typical and atypical adenomas. Our findings advocate for omitting the use of atypical adenoma terminology based solely on pathological evaluation. As stated in the 4th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, accurate tumor subtyping, evaluation of proliferation by means of mitotic count and K  i  -67 labeling index, and radiological and intraoperative assessments of tumor invasion should be taken into consideration in the management of such neoplasms.",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34306922,NA,82,Suppl 3,J Neurol Surg B Skull Base

They are rarely present in the thoracic and mediastinal areas; however, these locations have been reported in a few cases in the literature. We present the case of a woman with an intrathoracic BCM. A 28-year-old female patient presented with a cystic mass of 8 x 6 x 6 cm in the left hemithorax shown by computed tomography of the thorax. The patient underwent cystic mass excision with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), which was completed without complications. The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically after the surgical resection. Due to BMCs' non-specific clinical symptoms and radiological imaging, preoperative diagnosis is difficult, and they are often confused with pericardial cysts. There is no standard treatment protocol; however, VATS and en bloc resection are the most frequently used treatment options for mediastinal localization. Since these lesions' slow proliferation rates have the potential for local recurrence and low malignant transformation, close follow-up is recommended. İn this case report, we aimed to present a rare BCM case with intrathoracic paracardiac localization was completely excised through VATS.

The WHO'2015 classification recommends limiting immunocytochemistry(ICC) to lung cancer typing and molecular testing drives for personalized therapies. An algorithm using Bayes' theorem could be useful for defining antibody profiles. This study aims to assess the impact of using different antibody profiles for cytological samples on the accuracy of lung cancer typing with a large scale Bayesian analysis. Between 2011-2016 a total of 3,419 consecutive smears and/or cytospins were diagnosed. There were 1,960 primary lung cancer (972 adenocarcinomas (ADC), 256 squamous carcinomas(SQC), 268 neuroendocrine tumors[(NET);166 SCLC; 85 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma(LCNEC),7 atypical carcinoid(AC),10 typical carcinoid(TC)], and 464 tumors without any ADC, SQC or neuroendocrine growth features(NSCC-NOS). Before and after the use of ICC with single/combination of antibodies, the a priori and a posteriori probabilities for different lung cancer types were calculated. TTF-1 or CK7 alone improves the a posteriori probabilities of correct cytological typing of ADC to 86.5% and 95.8% respectively. In SQC, using p40(∆Np63) or CK5/6, CK5/14 led to comparable results (78.3% and 90.3%). With synaptophysin or CD56 alone a posteriori probabilities for the correct recognition of NET of 87.5 and 90.3% could be achieved. Based on morphological and clinical data, the use of two antibodies appears to be sufficient for the reliable detection of the different lung cancer types.

A total of 165 patients having 251 thyroid nodules with histopathologically proven definitive diagnoses during a 5-year period were included in this study. All patients had preoperatively undergone ultrasonography (US) examination, and US characteristics of the thyroid nodules were retrospectively analyzed and assigned in compliance with the thyroid imaging reporting and data system categories recommended by the ACR (ACR-TIRADS) and ETA (EU-TIRADS). The diagnostic effectiveness in the delineation of thyroid nodules and unnecessary fine-needle aspiration (FNAB) rates were evaluated. Overall, 189 nodules (75.30%) were diagnosed as benign, while 62 nodules (24.70%) were reported to be malignant based on histopathological assessment. Sensitivity and specificity rates were 71% and 75% for ACR-TIRADS and 73% and 80% for EU-TIRADS. The area under the curve values were 0.78 and 0.80 for ACR-TIRADS and EU-TIRADS, respectively. The unnecessary FNAB rates were 61% for ACR-TIRADS and 64% for EU-TIRADS as per the recommended criteria of each algorithm.

We aimed to investigate the potential effects of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) against white light-emitting diode (LED)-induced retinal degeneration (RD) in the rats. Twenty-eight male rats were allocated as: (i) Control, (ii) LED, (iii) LED + AITC (10 mg/kg BW), (iv) LED + AITC (20 mg/kg BW). Rats were administered with AITC for 28 days, followed by two days of intense environmental LED light (750  Lux ) exposure to the eyes. Animals were sacrificed immediately at the end of the study, then the blood and eyeballs were taken for the biochemical, western blotting, and histopathology examinations. AITC lowered the serum and retina malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while significantly ( p < 0.05) improving the retinal antioxidant enzyme activities in a dose-dependent manner. AITC improved retinal and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness as compared to the LED group ( p <  0.05). AITC increased the levels of Bax, caspase-3, HO-1, GAP43, and VEGF, while decreasing IL-1β, IL-6, NF-κB, Bcl-2, GFAP, Grp78, activating ATF4 and ATF6 as compared to the LED group ( p < 0.05).

Hematological and neurological expressed 1 ( HN1 ) also known as Jupiter Microtubule Associated Homolog 1 ( JPT1 ) belongs to a small poorly understood family of genes that are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species. The co-expression network of HN1 from the TCGA PRAD dataset indicates the putative role of HN1 in centrosome-related processes in the context of prostate cancer. HN1 expression is low in normal RWPE-1 cells as compared to cancerous androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen insensitive PC-3 cells. HN1 overexpression resulted in differential response for cell proliferation and cell cycle changes in RWPE-1, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells. Since HN1 overexpression increased the proliferation rate in PC-3 cells, these cells were used for functional characterization of HN1 in advanced prostate carcinogenesis. Furthermore, alterations in  HN  expression led to an increase in abnormal to normal nuclei ratio and increased chromosomal aberrations in PC-3 cells. We observed the co-localization of HN1 with γ-tubulin foci in prostate cancer cells, further validated by immunoprecipitation. HN1 was observed as physically associated with γ-tubulin and its depletion led to increased γ-tubulin foci and disruption in microtubule spindle assembly. Higher HN1 expression was correlated with prostate cancer as compared to normal tissues. The restoration of HN1 expression after silencing suggested that it has a role in centrosome clustering, implicating a potential role of HN1 in cell division as well as in prostate carcinogenesis warranting further studies.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34382911,NA,NA,NA,Cell Cycle

Among these prognostic factors, cytogenetic results are increasing in importance day by day. FLT3 mutations are among the most common molecular abnormalities in AML, patients with recurrent or refractory (R/R) AML with this mutation have a low response rate to salvage therapy. Gilteritinib has activity against FLT3, ALK and AXL. This article shall present two cases, for which Gilteritinib was used, a new FLT3 inhibitor, and the results of the treatment. Case 1: A 52-year-old female patient presented to the emergency clinic with weakness and fever. In initial biochemical analysis, leukocyte was 104000/mm 3 . Peripheral smear contained diffuse myeloid blastoid cells, peripheral blood flow cytometry also supported the AML M0-1 phenotype. The bone marrow biopsy aspiration performed on the 14 th  day of induction ""3+7"" treatment, contained diffuse blastic infiltrate and supported refractory disease. In addition to the FLAG-IDA salvage regimen, 120 mg/day Gilteritinib was also started. Bone marrow aspiration performed on the 28 th  day of salvage therapy was compatible with remission. Case 2: 53 years old male patient with also no comorbidity other than known hypertension. In the initial biochemical analysis of the patient, leukocyte was 156000/mm 3 , platelet 58000/mm 3  and hemoglobin 7.6 g/dl.

Overall 24 periampullary PDAC cases, in whom histomorphologic evaluation and CDx2 expression were used to discriminate between PBST and IST, were included. The lesion morphology (infiltrative versus nodular), common bile and main pancreatic ducts' dilation, tumor grade, enhancement pattern, pancreaticoduodenal groove, pancreaticoduodenal artery and lymphatic involvement were evaluated by CT. Overall 24 PDAC cases [median age 67.5 (60.5-76.5) years] were enrolled. Histopathology revealed 9 (25%) IST and 18 (75%) PBST. The age [72.5 (69-81) versus 63 (57.75-75.5) years, respectively, p=0.204] and gender [3 (50%) versus 12 (66.7%) males, respectively, p=0.635] and the prevalence of all CT characteristics were similar between groups (p>0.05 for all) except for lesion morphology. Infiltrative morphology was more frequent in PBST than IST [14 (77.8%) versus 1 (16.7%), respectively, p=0.015]. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis revealed infiltrative morphology as the only independent CT predictor of PBST [OR: 14.9, 95% CI: 1.2-186), p=0.036]. The interrater reproducibility for lesion morphology was moderate (Cohen's Kappa: 0.55, p<0.007). Infiltrative appearance is associated with PBST; whereas, nodular appearance more likely predicts IST.

The enlargement of the diving ranula is generally downward in the neck. If the opposite occurs, we may encounter very interesting and difficult cases. Diving ranula should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of cystic neck masses in the pediatric age group and its treatment should be done surgically.A 15-year-old girl admitted to our clinic with the complaint of swelling in the floor of the mouth and neck. In physical examination of the patient, a mass with cystic content was observed adjacent to the left Wharton canal. In addition, a 4 × 3 cm, soft, fluctuant, nonfixed, painless mass was palpated in the left submandibular area. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the neck mass was a diving ranula extending from the parapharyngeal space to the skull base. In the surgery, submandibular and sublingual salivary glands were removed together with the diving ranula. We observed no complications in the postoperative period.Magnetic resonance imaging should be used to confirm the diagnosis of diving ranula.

AR splice variant 7 (ARv7) is the most commonly observed isoform and strongly correlates with resistance to second-generation anti-androgens. Despite this clinical evidence, the interplay between ARv7 and the highly expressed full-length AR (ARfl) remains unclear. In this work, we show that ARfl/ARv7 heterodimers readily form in the nucleus via an intermolecular N/C interaction that brings the four termini of the proteins in close proximity. Combining fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate that these heterodimers undergo conformational changes following DNA binding, indicating dynamic nuclear receptor interaction. Although transcriptionally active, ARv7 can only form short-term interactions with DNA at highly accessible high-occupancy ARfl binding sites. Dimerization with ARfl does not affect ARv7 binding dynamics, suggesting that DNA binding occupancy is determined by the individual protein monomers and not the homodimer or heterodimer complex. Overall, these biophysical studies reveal detailed properties of ARv7 dynamics as both a homodimer or heterodimer with ARfl.",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34318896,NA,134,14,J Cell Sci

34418333,2021,8,NA,NA,Oxidative and pro-inflammatory lung injury induced by desflurane inhalation in rats and the protective effect of rutin.,NA,"Desflurane is a mainstay of general inhaled anesthetics with a methyl ethyl ether structure and is widely used in clinical practice. It has been reported to induce inflammation and lipid peroxidation in rat pulmonary parenchyma, to increase alveolar macrophages, and to cause peribronchial infiltration and edema. Rutin, a flavonoid vitamin P1, is known to have biological properties including acting as an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and an inhibitor of bronchoalveolar polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PNL) infiltration. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of rutin on desflurane-induced pulmonary injury using biochemical and histopathological methods. The rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 6 each): healthy control (HC), rutin+desflurane-treated (DRT) and desflurane-only (DSF). Briefly, 50 mg/kg of rutin was given orally to the DRT group and an equal volume of normal saline was given to the DSF and HC groups. After 1 h, anesthesia was induced and maintained in the DRT and DSF groups for 2 h. After the rats had been sacrificed, the lungs were removed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) levels were measured in the excised lung tissue. The removed tissues were also fixed in 10% formalin, and the obtained sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated under light microscopy. The biochemical and histopathological results of the DRT group were compared with those obtained from the DSF and HC groups. Desflurane increased MDA, TNF-α and NF-κB, and decreased GSH in lung tissue. The PNL infiltration, alveolar macrophages, hemorrhage, alveolar damage, and edema were observed in the lung tissue of the DSF group. Rutin was histopathologically shown to protect lung tissue from oxidative stress by preventing an increase in oxidant parameters and a decrease in antioxidants. The results suggest that rutin may be useful in the treatment of desflurane-associated lung injury.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34418333,NA,NA,NA,Adv Clin Exp Med

Here we characterize the lesions of infectious bronchitis (IB) and IBV prevalence and identify the circulating strains in small flocks in California. Backyard chickens (BYCs) submitted to the Davis (Northern California; NorCal) and San Bernardino (Southern California; SoCal) branches of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System from January through March 2019 were included in the study. Trachea, kidney, and cecal tonsils were collected for real-time reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and sequence analysis. A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds, while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation, and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens that succumbed to other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed, and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains.

External mRNA datasets were used for expression analysis and/or to validate survival associations. External transcriptomic datasets showed downregulation of IVL and KRT13 in oral malignancies including OTSCC as compared to normal controls. The combined loss of IVL and CK13 expression at the invading core but not at the center core was significantly associated with poor differentiation and reduced 5-year overall survival. Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the loss of CK13 and IVL expression to be an independent prognostic factor. Transcriptomic dataset corroborated immunohistochemistry results.

We aimed to investigate if there are taste buds cored neural networks in the pancreas, and there is any relationship between blood glucose levels.  Methods:  This examination was done on 32 chosen rats with their glucose levels. Animals are divided into owned blood glucose levels. If mean glucose levels were equal to 105 ± 10 mg/dL accepted as euglycemic (G-I; n = 14), 142 ± 18 mg/dL values accepted as hyperglycemic (G-II; n = 9) and 89 ± 9 mg/dL accepted as hypoglycemic (G-III; n = 9). After the experiment, animals were sacrificed under general anesthesia. Their pancreatic tissues were examined histological methods and numbers of newly described taste bud networks analyzed by Stereological methods. Results compared with Mann-Whitney U test  P   < 0.005 considered as significant.  Results:  The mean normal blood glucose level (mg/dL) and taste bud network densities of per cm 3  were: 105 ± 10 mg/dL; 156±21 in G-I; 142 ± 18 mg/dL and 95 ± 14 in G-II and 89 ± 9 mg/dL and 232 ± 34 in G-III.

Two weeks after treatment with 100 μM of TDZ, new shoots were half as long as those in control plants, and stem diameters were about 40% greater. This effect of TDZ is associated with changes in cell architecture. Although TDZ treatment stimulated ethylene production by the plants, inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis (2-aminoethoxyvinyl glycine) or action (silver thiosulfate) did not affect the response of plants to TDZ. We found that TDZ treatment significantly suppressed the expression of bioactive gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis genes encoding GA3 and GA20 oxidases and slightly increased the expression of GA catabolism genes encoding GA2 oxidase. Application of GA 3  and TDZ together resulted in normal elongation growth, although stem diameters were still somewhat thicker.

Methodology:  A double-centered, hospital-based comparative retrospective case study was conducted, to include all the admitted patients ( n  = 317) having COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive. The control group ( n  = 157) tested negative for COVID-19. Results:  Of 317 admitted cases, the majority were males  n  = 198 (62.5%). Associated comorbidities, lower lymphocytes, platelets, and higher White blood cells, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were found in COVID-19 cases as compared to healthy controls ( p  < 0.001 for all). The biochemical parameters of cases including Ferritin, D-Dimer, CRP, IL-6, LDH, ALT, AST, and APTT also showed a statistically significant difference compared with standard values ( p  < 0.001 for all). However, their comparison with a severity level of the severe and non-severe groups showed significance for WBCs, neutrophils, NLR ( p  < 0.001 for all), and PLR ( p  = 0.06) only.

Management of mucositis involves multiple approaches from oral hygiene, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, cytoprotective, and antioxidant agents, to cryo-therapy, physical therapy, and growth factors. There is room for novel, affordable treatment options, or improvement of currently available therapies. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate mucosa-resident cell populations such as Th17 or innate lymphoid cells and critical mucosal cytokine IL-22; however, their therapeutic potential has not been put to test in preclinical mouse models. In this study, we aimed to test the therapeutic potential of vitamin D injections and IL-22 overexpression in a murine model of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Balb/c mice were given daily intraperitoneal injections of vitamin D. Mucositis was induced by methotrexate. Another group received IL-22 plasmid via hydrodynamic gene delivery. Weight loss and intestinal histopathology, intestinal levels of cytokines IL-22, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IL-23, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10, and number of intestinal lamina propria B cell, neutrophil, and total innate lymphoid cells were quantified. Daily vitamin D injections ameliorated intestinal inflammation and elevated intestinal IL-22 levels compared with control groups. Temporal overexpression of IL-22 by hydrodynamic gene delivery slightly increased intestinal IL-22 but failed to confer significant protection from mucositis. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration in an animal model of mucositis of therapeutic use of vitamin D and IL-22 supplementation and our results with vitamin D suggest it may have merit in further trials in human mucositis patients.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34348356,NA,NA,NA,Anticancer Drugs

We aimed to explore the potential protective effect of a second rectal enema before biopsy. Between January 2015 and December 2020, 419 patients were assessed retrospectively. Patients with a history of anticoagulant use, uncontrolled diabetes, urological surgery, prostate biopsy, or recent hospitalization or overseas travel, as well as those with previous prostatitis, were excluded from the study. The patients were subsequently divided into two groups: Group 1(n=223) had received one enema, on the morning of the biopsy, and Group 2(n=196) had received two, with the additional enema administered half an hour before the procedure. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age(p=0.076), BMI(p=0.489), diabetes(p=0.265), prostate-specific antigen(PSA) level(p=0.193), free/total PSA (f/t PSA) ratio(p=0.518), and prostate size(p=0.661) or in relation to cancer detection(p=0.428).

However, there was no significant difference in terms of fever and sepsis(p=0.524andp=0.548,respectively). Additionally, subgroup analysis demonstrated that UTI was significantly lower in patients with diabetes mellitus who had received a second enema(p=0.004), though there was no significant difference in UTI between the groups in those without diabetes mellitus(p=0.215).

Inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as Hepatitis A and smallpox proved to be reliable approaches for immunization for prolonged periods. In this study, a gamma-irradiated inactivated virus vaccine does not require an extra purification process, unlike the chemically inactivated vaccines. Hence, the novelty of our vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) is that it is a non-adjuvant added, gamma-irradiated, and intradermally applied inactive viral vaccine. Efficiency and safety dose (either 10 13  or 10 14  viral RNA copy per dose) of OZG-38.61.3 was initially determined in BALB/c mice. This was followed by testing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccine. Human ACE2-encoding transgenic mice were immunized and then infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the challenge test.

Methodology:  A total of 2,138 blood samples of suspected typhoid patients from Northwest Pakistan were collected followed by identification of  Salmonella  Typhi through biochemical, serological, and species-specific  fliC-d  gene amplification. These isolates were typed by variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) profiling and investigated for drug resistance.  Results:  The overall prevalence of  Salmonella  Typhi was found to be 8.8% ( n  = 189). Thirty different VNTR strain types of  Salmonella  Typhi were detected and the most prevalent strain types were T1 and T4, whereas T27 was less prevalent strain. Among the 189 isolates 175 (92.5%) isolates were multidrug resistant, whereas 12 (5.8%) isolates were extensively drug resistant. Resistance to imipenem in  Salmonella  Typhi was not observed. Most of the isolates have genes encoding for resistance to fluoroquinolones, including  gyrA  ( n  = 164),  gyrB  ( n  = 160),  parC  ( n  = 164),  parE  ( n  = 160),  ac (6')- ib - cr  ( n  = 163),  qnrS  ( n  = 15), and  qnrB  ( n  = 3). Similarly, chloramphinicol ( cat; n  = 147), azithromycin ( msrA; n  = 3), and co-trimoxazole ( dfrA7; n  = 145 )  resistance genes were detected among  Salmonella  Typhi isolates.  Conclusion:  In this study, T1 and T4 type  Salmonella  Typhi strains were predominantly prevalent in Northwest Pakistan. Antibiotic resistance among  Salmonella  Typhi isolates were observed. Findings of the study would be helpful to devise an appropriate antibiotic policy to control the emergence of drug-resistant  Salmonella  Typhi in Pakistan.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34357814,NA,NA,NA,Microb Drug Resist

Health and social management of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, responsible for the COVID-19 disease, requires both screening tools and diagnostic procedures. Reliable screening tests aim at identifying (truely) infectious individuals that can spread the viral infection and therefore are essential for tracing and harnessing the epidemic diffusion. Instead, diagnostic tests should supplement clinical and radiological findings, thus helping in establishing the diagnosis. Several analytical assays, mostly using RT-PCR-based technologies, have become commercially available for healthcare workers and clinical laboratories. However, such tests showed some critical limitations, given that a relevant number of both false-positive and false-negative cases have been so far reported. Moreover, those analytical techniques demonstrated to be significantly influenced by pre-analytical biases, while the sensitivity showed a dramatic time dependency.  Aim.  Herein, we critically investigate limits and perspectives of currently available RT-PCR techniques, especially when referring to the required performances in providing reliable epidemiological and clinical information.  Key Concepts.  Current data cast doubt on the use of RT-PCR swabs as a screening procedure for tracing the evolution of the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Indeed, the huge number of both false-positive and false-negative results deprives the trustworthiness of decision making based on those data. Therefore, we should refine current available analytical tests to quickly identify individuals able to really transmit the virus, with the aim to control and prevent large outbreaks.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34357032,NA,11,7,Life (Basel)

Pathologic grading of tumors was performed according to the criteria specified by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Histopathologic types, histopathologic grading, and all histopathologic characteristics were determined using the Lauren and World Health Organization (WHO) classificationsForty-three surgically treated GC cases were examined in terms of TB according to the International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC) and budding grading [budding degree (Bd)] was performed. They were recorded as Bd1 (1-4 buddings), Bd2 (5-9 buddings), or Bd3 (10 buddings or more). Bd score, clinicopathologic parameters, and prognostic factors were analyzed. There were 13 (30.2%) Bd1, 11 (25.6%) Bd2, and 19 (44.2%) Bd3 cases. A statistically significant relationship was found between Bd scores and pT, N, and histologic grade (p<0.01, p<0.05).

We hypothesized that under-appreciated vascular wall-resident stem and progenitor cells (VW-SPCs) might be involved in tumor vascularization and influence effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapy. Indeed, in patient samples, we observed that vascular adventitia-resident CD34 +  VW-SPCs are recruited to tumors in situ from co-opted vessels. To elucidate this in detail, we established an ex vivo model using concomitant embedding of multi-cellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) and mouse aortic rings (ARs) into collagen gels, similar to the so-called aortic ring assay (ARA). Moreover, ARA was modified by removing the ARs' adventitia that harbors VW-SPCs. Thus, this model enabled distinguishing the contribution of VW-SPCs from that of mature endothelial cells (ECs) to new vessel formation. Our results show that the formation of capillary-like sprouts is considerably delayed, and their number and network formation were significantly reduced by removing the adventitia. Substituting iPSC-derived neural spheroids for MCTS resulted in distinct sprouting patterns that were also strongly influenced by the presence or absence of VW-SPCs, also underlying the involvement of these cells in non-pathological vascularization.

Fifty-one naïve patients with HCC were included in the study. The tumors were classified according to the Edmondson-Steiner grade and separated as well-differentiated and non-well-differentiated (moderately and poorly differentiated). The ADC parameters of groups were compared by applying Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between tumors' histopathological stage and whole tumor ADC parameters was investigated using Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (ROC) was applied to calculate the area under curve (AUC) with intersection point of ADC parameters and curve. Mean and percentile ADC values of well-differentiated tumors were significantly higher than those of non-well-differentiated tumors (p < 0.05). The strongest correlation between histopathological grade and ADC parameters was 75th percentile ADC (r = - 0.501), 50th percentile ADC (r = - 0.476) and mean ADC (r = - 0.465). Mean, 75th and 50th percentile ADC values used for the distinction of groups gave the highest AUC at ROC analysis (0.781, 0.781, 0.767, respectively). When threshold values of mean, 75th and 50th percentile ADC values were applied (1516 mm 2 /s, 1194 mm 2 /s, and 1035 mm 2 /s) sensitivity was calculated as 0.73, 0.91, 0.83, respectively, and specificity was calculated as 0.82, 0.61, and 0.68, respectively. A correlation between whole tumor volumetric ADC values and HCCs' histopathological grade was detected in this study. 75th percentile, 50th percentile and mean ADC values are determined as highly sensitive and specific tests when the threshold values are applied for distinguishing between well-differentiated tumors and moderately/poorly differentiated tumors.

34380837,2021,6,NA,NA,Extended-spectrum of KRAS and NRAS mutations in lung cancer tissue specimens obtained with bronchoscopy.,NA,"Mutations in the RAS genes, HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, are the most common modifications in many types of human tumors and are found in approximately 30% of all human cancers. These mutations are usually found in codons 12, 13, or 61. The aim of this study is to evaluate mutations in codons 59, 117, and 146 of KRAS and NRAS genes in addition to codons 12,13, and 61 of KRAS gene in lung cancer tissue specimens obtained with bronchoscopy. KRAS and NRAS mutation analyses with pyrosequencing were performed on DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of 64 patients histopathologically diagnosed as lung cancer after bronchoscopic biopsy. In all, 20 patients (31.2%) had mutations in KRAS gene (8/27 squamous cell carcinoma, 8/11 adenocarcinoma, 3/16 small cell carcinoma, and 1/1 pleomorphic carcinoma). The most common mutation in codon 12 was in c.35G>T (G12V). When the mutation rate of adenocarcinoma (72.7%) and squamous cell carcinoma (22.9%) patients was compared with each other, a statistically significant difference was observed (P = 0.008). There were no mutations in codons 59, 117, or 146 of KRAS and NRAS genes in patients with lung cancer. In this study, we firstly examined mutations in codons 59, 117, and 146 of KRAS and NRAS genes in addition to codons 12, 13, and 61 of KRAS gene in Turkish lung cancer patients both in non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Although no mutation was detected in codons 59, 117, and 146 of KRAS and NRAS genes, the frequency of KRAS gene mutation was higher than the rate of mutation in both Asian and Western countries, and multicenter studies including more cases should be performed to further explore our results.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34380837,NA,NA,NA,Indian J Cancer

The 65 living-donor kidney-transplant recipients in our cohort underwent renal biopsy to investigate possible graft dysfunction. The patients were divided into 2 groups, according to pathology reports: chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD; n = 18) and antibody-mediated/humoral allograft rejection (AMR; n = 16). The control group was composed of renal transplant recipients with stable health (n = 33). We performed serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cystatin C, urine protein, CXCL10, and metabolome analyses on specimens from the patients. BUN, creatinine, cystatin C, urine protein, leucine + isoleucine, citrulline, and free/acetyl/propionyl carnitine levels were significantly higher in patients with CAD and AMR, compared with the control individuals. CXCL10 levels were significantly elevated in patients with AMR, compared with patients with CAD and controls. CXCL10 (AUC = 0.771) and cystatin C (AUC = 0.746) were significantly higher in the AMR group, compared with the CAD group (P<.02).

Replacement of an electron microscope (EM), fitted with an updated digital camera, and use of new software for imaging and analysis prompted this QA study to ensure that new equipment, imaging, and measurement of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) produced data consistent with the laboratory's established range of normal width. GBM measurements from 14 randomly selected human renal biopsies were compared using five different approaches. Original measurements of GBMs obtained on the laboratory's previous EM were compared to images collected on the new microscope with measurements performed using new software, as well as the original images and the new images measured using a separate software method as a control. The widths obtained by five approaches were compared to each other. While measurements showed minor variability between the approaches, significant difference in GBM width was noted in three of the paired comparisons. In some cases, these differences suggested slight diagnostic changes. Evaluation of new equipment, software, and techniques is important for a laboratory's quality assurance. While new equipment and/or procedures can introduce errors in test outcomes, we found that different EMs, cameras, and software made slight differences in our laboratory's values for kidney GBM width. However, a few cases showed enough difference in GBM width to suggest a change in diagnosis, illustrating the necessity of calibration adjustments in the setting of new equipment and software.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34387014,NA,NA,NA,Microsc Res Tech

Slit-lamp examination showed a firm, immobile mass measuring 13.0 × 5.0 × 5.0 mm with yellowish creamy color. The mass was completely removed surgically under local anesthesia mainly for diagnosis. Histopathology revealed typical morphological features of a filarioid nematode in favor of Dirofilaria as characterized by the external smooth cuticular surface, cuticular layer, muscle layer, and intestinal tubule. Molecular study was performed using DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the worm. PCR amplification and then DNA sequence analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene fragment confirmed that the worm was D. immitis.

To identify the genetic variants associated with juvenile ALS. In this multicenter family-based genetic study, trio whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the disease-associated gene in a case series of unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and severe growth retardation. The patients and their family members were enrolled at academic hospitals and a government research facility between March 1, 2016, and March 13, 2020, and were observed until October 1, 2020. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed in a series of patients with juvenile ALS. A total of 66 patients with juvenile ALS and 6258 adult patients with ALS participated in the study. Patients were selected for the study based on their diagnosis, and all eligible participants were enrolled in the study. None of the participants had a family history of neurological disorders, suggesting de novo variants as the underlying genetic mechanism. De novo variants present only in the index case and not in unaffected family members. Trio whole-exome sequencing was performed in 3 patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and their parents. An additional 63 patients with juvenile ALS and 6258 adult patients with ALS were subsequently screened for variants in the SPTLC1 gene. De novo variants in SPTLC1 (p.Ala20Ser in 2 patients and p.Ser331Tyr in 1 patient) were identified in 3 unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and failure to thrive. A fourth variant (p.Leu39del) was identified in a patient with juvenile ALS where parental DNA was unavailable. Variants in this gene have been previously shown to be associated with autosomal-dominant hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type 1A, by disrupting an essential enzyme complex in the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. These data broaden the phenotype associated with SPTLC1 and suggest that patients presenting with juvenile ALS should be screened for variants in this gene.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34459874,NA,NA,NA,JAMA Neurol

Clinical findings vary by age of the patient, the organ systems involved, and the severity of the CFTR gene mutation. Pancreatic and liver involvement is prominent and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is observed in the majority of patients. Point shear wave elastography (pSWE) is a non-invasive method that can quantitatively determine tissue elasticity and stiffness. In this study, the morphological evaluation of the pancreas was performed using the pSWE technique in pediatric patients diagnosed with CF. The effectiveness of this method for early detection of pancreatic insufficiency was investigated. Fifty-five patients with CF (24 girls, 31 boys) and 60 healthy children (29 girls, 31 boys) without any chronic diseases and who were suitable for the pSWE examination were included in the study. The mean value of pSWE was 1.12±0.16 in the healthy group and 0.97±0.16 in the patients with cystic fibrosis. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p <0.001).

The aim of this study was to look into whether lamotrigine treatment could protect the spinal cord from experimental spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury. Thirty-two rats, eight rats per group, were randomly assigned to the sham group in which only laparotomy was performed, and to the ischemia, methylprednisolone and lamotrigine groups, where the infrarenal aorta was clamped for thirty minutes to induce spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury. Tissue samples belonging to spinal cords were harvested from sacrificed animals twenty-four hours after reperfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, interleukin-1 beta levels, nitric oxide levels, superoxide dismutase activity, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, malondialdehyde levels and caspase-3 activity were studied. Light and electron microscopic evaluations were also performed to reveal the pathological alterations. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale and the inclined-plane test was used to evaluate neurofunctional status at the beginning of the study and just before the animals were sacrificed. Lamotrigine treatment provided significant improvement in the neurofunctional status by preventing the increase in cytokine expression, increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, depletion of antioxidant enzymes activity and increased apoptosis, all of which contributing to spinal cord damage through different paths after ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore, lamotrigine treatment has shown improved results concerning the histopathological and ultrastructural scores and the functional tests.

In this paper we aimed to provide an overview on the diversity of control for these diseases in Europe. A non-EU regulated cattle disease was defined as an infectious disease of cattle with no or limited control at EU level, which is not included in the European Union Animal health law Categories A or B under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/2002. A CP was defined as surveillance and/or intervention strategies designed to lower the incidence, prevalence, mortality or prove freedom from a specific disease in a region or country. Passive surveillance, and active surveillance of breeding bulls under Council Directive 88/407/EEC were not considered as CPs. A questionnaire was designed to obtain country-specific information about CPs for each disease. Animal health experts from 33 European countries completed the questionnaire. Overall, there are 23 diseases for which a CP exists in one or more of the countries studied. The diseases for which CPs exist in the highest number of countries are enzootic bovine leukosis, bluetongue, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhoea and anthrax (CPs reported by between 16 and 31 countries). Every participating country has on average, 6 CPs (min-max: 1-13) in place. Most programmes are implemented at a national level (86%) and are applied to both dairy and non-dairy cattle (75%). Approximately one-third of the CPs are voluntary, and the funding structure is divided between government and private resources. Countries that have eradicated diseases like enzootic bovine leukosis, bluetongue, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine viral diarrhoea have implemented CPs for other diseases to further improve the health status of cattle in their country. The control of non-EU regulated cattle diseases is very heterogenous in Europe.

Next, the alterations in survival rate, hatching rate, and morphology of the larvae at 96 h were monitored. The survival rates decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological defects such as yolk sac edema, pericardial edema, spinal curvature, and tail malformation in the NP-treated larvae were observed. RP-Ag/AC NPs stimulated the production of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and 8-OHdG in zebrafish brain tissues in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced neutrophil degeneration and necrosis at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/L.

A study of patient- and lymph node- based analyses.,NA,"Gallium-68 (68Ga)-Prostate Membrane Specific Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) is an emerging diagnostic modality which is gaining importance in individualized prostate cancer (PCa) management era. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging before radical prostatectomy (RP) in intermediate and high risk PCa. The retrospectively documented 49 patients with intermediate and high risk non-metastatic PCa who had  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT before RP were enrolled into this study. The histopathology of dissected LNs was used as reference standard to evaluate the accuracy of  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging, both in per-patient (n = 49) and in per-node (n = 454) analyses. The diagnostic accuracy was investigated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and by area under the curve (AUC) provided using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. Median age was 64 (48-79) years and, median and mean PSA values were 10 (1.31-138) ng/ml and 16.2 (±19.8) ng/ml, respectively. 22 (44.9%) and 27 (55.1%) of patients had intermediate and high risk PCa, respectively. A total of 5 (10.2%) patients had histopathologically proven LN metastasis and 3 (60%) of them was detected in  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT. In per patient analysis, the sensitivity, specifity, PPV and NPV of  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging were 0.60, 0.96, 0.60 and 0.96, respectively. Among overall 454 LNs, 16 (3.5 %) of them were reported as metastatic in histopathology and, 13 (2.9%) of these metastatic LNs were detected in  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT. In per-node analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging were 0.82, 0.99, 0.87 and 0.99, respectively. The ROC analyses found AUCs for primary LN staging as 0.777 (95%CI:0.508-1.0) in per patient analysis and, as 0.904 (95%CI:0.790 - 1.0) in per node analysis, respectively. The use of  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT has promising diagnostic accuracy on primary LN staging before RP in intermediate and high risk PCa.

We aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to artificial food colorings during the intrauterine period on the salivary glands in adulthood. A total of 30 Wistar albino female pregnant rats were included in this study. The treatment group was given a mixture of nine artificial food colorings at no observed adverse-effect-level doses. Neither mothers nor offspring were fed with food colorings after delivery. When the offspring became adults, they were sacrificed, and the possible histopathological and immunohistochemical effects of artificial food colorings on the salivary glands were investigated. In these glands, anti-matrix metallopeptidase 2 (anti-MMP2), anti-MMP9, anti-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (anti-TIMP1), anti-TIMP2, and anti-TIMP3 were examined. The expressions of anti-MMP2, anti-TIMP1, anti-TIMP2, and anti-TIMP3 parameters were found to be higher in treatment groups (p<0.05). It was suggested that intrauterine exposure of synthetic food colorings may lead to deterioration of the tissue structure of the salivary glands in adulthood, thereby increasing susceptibility to chronic illnesses including malignancy and chronic inflammation.

Mediastinal tumors can be misdiagnosed because their symptoms or signs can overlap with cardiovascular diseases, which have a higher prevalence among the older population. The diagnostic process should be managed with multimodality imaging and clinical judgement. Here, the case of a 74-year-old male patient, who presented with shortness of breath, is examined. A chest X-ray revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio, and he was diagnosed with hemopericardium following an emergent chest computed tomography. In the echocardiography, it was suspected that a hyperechogenic area adjacent to the heart might be due to a mass, and further examinations confirmed a mediastinal neoplasm. A surgical biopsy was performed, and it was determined to be a mesenchymal tumor. To conclude, clinicians should keep in mind the possibility of paracardiac neoplasm in the elderly, as well as in other age groups, when encountering mediastinal widening so that the patient can be protected from unnecessary interventions such as pericardiocentesis.",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34404995,NA,18,7,J Geriatr Cardiol

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of submucosal mesna infiltration on microflap elevation and the histopathological findings of its effects on the vocal fold lamina propria in a rabbit model. Eight adult male New Zealand white rabbits were used in the study. Each vocal fold was randomized, and 0.1 mL of mesna was injected into one-fold and 0.1 mL of saline to the contralateral fold. An incision was made on the epithelium and elevation was performed. The animals were sacrificed after two weeks, and the vocal folds were excised. Inflammatory response, fibrosis, and epithelial thickness were evaluated with hematoxylin eosin and Masson's Trichrome staining. Elevation time and histopathological features were compared between the two groups. The elevation time (20.9 ± 1.6 second) in the saline group was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the mesna group (15.0 ± 3.4 second). The inflammation (1.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.1 ± 1.0, respectively) and fibrosis scores (1.0 ± 0.8 vs. 0.8 ± 0.7, respectively) did not differ significantly (P > 0.05 in both). Epithelial thickness (12.5 ± 4.7 vs. 10.3 ± 5.3, respectively) did not differ significantly (P ˃ 0.05) in the mesna and saline groups either.

34411028,2021,8,NA,NA,Routine Elastin Staining in Surgically Resected Colorectal Cancer: Impact on Venous Invasion Detection and its Association With Oncologic Outcomes.,NA,"Venous invasion (VI) is a powerful yet underreported prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC). Its detection can be improved with an elastin stain. We evaluated the impact of routine elastin staining on VI detection in resected CRC and its relationship with oncologic outcomes. Pathology reports from the year before (n=145) and the year following (n=128) the implementation of routine elastin staining at our institution were reviewed for established prognostic factors, including VI. A second review, using elastin stains, documented the presence/absence, location, number, and size of VI foci. The relationship between VI and oncologic outcomes was evaluated for original and review assessments. VI detection rates increased from 21% to 45% following implementation of routine elastin staining (odds ratio [OR]=3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-5.3; P<0.0001). The second review revealed a lower VI miss rate postimplementation than preimplementation (22% vs. 48%, respectively; P=0.007); this difference was even greater for extramural VI-positive cases (9% vs. 38%, respectively; P=0.0003). Missed VI cases postimplementation had fewer VI foci per missed case (P=0.02) and a trend towards less extramural VI than those missed preimplementation. VI assessed with an elastin stain was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (P=0.003), and cancer-specific survival (P=0.01) in contrast to VI assessed on hematoxylin and eosin alone (P=0.053 and 0.1, respectively). The association between VI and hematogenous metastasis was far stronger for elastin-detected VI (OR=11.5; 95% CI: 3.4-37.1; P<0.0001) than for hematoxylin and eosin-detected VI (OR=3.7; 95% CI: 1.4-9.9; P=0.01).

We aimed to evaluate the survival impact of number of removed lymph nodes and their localizations in stage I EOC. This study included 182 patients. The best cut-off levels for number of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (PaLN) were 24 and 10, respectively. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed for these cut-offs and other prognostic factors. The median age of the patients was 49. The median number of removed pelvic and paraartic lymph nodes were 29 and 9, respectively. The median overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 67 and 50 months, respectively. The 5-year OS rate was 89.6%. Recurrence occured in 24 (19.5%) patients. In univariate analyses tumor grade (p: 0.005), pelvic LN number (p: 0.041) and PaLN number (p: 0.004) were the factors that were significantly associated with PFS. Tumor grade and PaLN number were independently and significantly associated with PFS in multivariate analyses (p: 0.015 and p: 0.017, respectively). In OS analyses, age, tumor grade, presence of LVI, number of pelvic and PaLNs were the significantly associated factors (p < 0.05 for all). In multivariate analyses, age and PaLN number were independently and significantly associated with OS (p: 0.011 and p: 0.021, respectively).

Nevertheless, approximately 20% of all tubulopathy patients lack a genetic diagnosis.  Methods  We performed whole-exome and genome sequencings of a patient cohort with a novel inherited salt-losing tubulopathy, hypomagnesemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. We also conducted subsequent functional analyses  in vitro  of identified variants of  RRAGD , a gene that encodes a small Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase).  Results  In eight children from unrelated families with a tubulopathy characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, salt wasting, and nephrocalcinosis, we identified heterozygous missense variants in  RRAGD  that mostly occurred  de novo  Six of these patients also had dilated cardiomyopathy and three underwent heart transplantation. We identified a heterozygous variant in  RRAGD  that segregated with the phenotype in eight members of a large family with similar kidney manifestations. The GTPase RagD encoded by  RRAGD  plays a role in mediating amino acid signaling to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). RagD expression along the mammalian nephron included the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule. The identified  RRAGD  variants were shown to induce a constitutive activation of mTOR signaling  in vitro   Conclusions  Our findings establish a novel disease, which we call autosomal dominant kidney hypomagnesemia (ADKH-RRAGD), that combines an electrolyte-losing tubulopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. The condition is caused by variants in the  RRAGD  gene, which encodes Rag GTPase D; these variants lead to an activation of mTOR signaling, suggesting a critical role of Rag GTPase D for renal electrolyte handling and cardiac function.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34607910,NA,NA,NA,J Am Soc Nephrol

Whole-mount staining results showed that EC caused dose-dependent increased apoptosis. Oxidative stress caused by EC exposure was demonstrated by whole-mount staining, transcriptional and immunohistochemically. Furthermore, it has been shown histochemically that EC exposure causes necrosis and degeneration in the brain. In behavioral tests, it was observed that EC caused hyperactivity associated with these neuronal degenerations.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common type of colonic lymphoma and represents less than 0.5% of colorectal neoplasms. Chemotherapeutical agents are gateway to disease remission and sometimes cure in most patients but surgery may be necessary in emergent situations. A 77-year-old male patient presented with abdominal discomfort, constipation, and obstructive defecation symptoms. Radiological imaging revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon extending towards the rectum. Colonoscopy was performed and biopsy of a nearly 10 cm ulcerovegetative lesion was obtained. Histological examination following biopsy revealed it to be a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the sigmoid colon. There was no indication for surgery and the patient was referred to medical oncology clinic for chemotherapy treatment. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a lymphoproliferative disorder with the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most common subtype. The DLBCL subtype is rarely observed in the colon and rectum. Chromosomal abnormalities are involved in the pathophysiology and gene rearrangements lead to adjustments in lymphocyte function and differentiation. In this case report, we present a rare presentation of a Non-Hodgkin lymphoma presenting in the sigmoid colon. The disease can present with nonspecific symptoms and various imaging modalities along with histopathological evaluation is necessary for the correct subtyping of lymphoma. Chemoradiotherapy is key for treatment, and surgery is usually reserved for cases of obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34600235,NA,87,NA,Int J Surg Case Rep

From November 2002 to June 2019, 11 patients (9 males) with a mean age of 33.45 years (range, 19-54 years) were operated on for BLT. All patients underwent wide local excision and V-Y flap reconstruction, supplemented with other flaps whenever needed. No additional modalities were used. Two patients had a history of anal intercourse while all patients were human immunodeficiency virus-negative. The mean tumor length was 15.54 ± 1.34 cm (range, 10-26 cm). Human papillomavirus 6 was the most common type identified. Partial wound dehiscence developed in 3 patients, while anal stenosis, mucosal ectropion, or local recurrence was not observed during the mean follow-up period of 50.45 ± 1.75 months (range, 10-196 months).

Ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2, significantly reduces constitutional symptoms and spleen size compared with placebo, and has significant clinical benefits in patients with myelofibrosis. The most common haematological side effects are thrombocytopenia and anaemia, and the most common non-haematological side effects are grade 1-2 diarrhoea and pyrexia. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is small vessel vasculitis, characterized histopathologically by immune complex-mediated vasculitis of the dermal capillaries and venules in the lower extremities, which can be seen as palpable purpura. Although the cause is 50% idiopathic, the aetiology of leukocytoclastic vasculitis can be collected under many headings. The case is here presented of a patient with PMF who developed leukocytoclastic vasculitis after ruxolitinib treatment. Ruxolitinib was discontinued as the lesions were thought to be drug-related and all skin lesions disappeared approximately 2 months after termination of the drug. When the ruxolitinib treatment was restarted at the same dose (2 × 15 mg), the skin lesions recurred. The drug dose was reduced to 1 × 15 mg, and the rashes disappeared. Currently, the patient has no active complaints and is being followed up with ruxolitinib 1 × 15 mg without any complications. To the best of our knowledge, leukocytoclastic vasculitis due to ruxolitinib is extremely uncommon.

These foreign bodies represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. A 57-year-old female presented to us with right upper abdominal pain. Her past history was non-contributory except for an open cholecystectomy 20 years previously. A physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation on the right of the abdomen, while the remaining examination was normal. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a well-defined calcified mass of 5 cm that was compatible with a mesenteric cyst. During surgery, the mass was found to be adherent to the mesocolon and to have invaded the colon wall. A right hemicolectomy and ileotransverse anastomosis was performed. The pathological mass was considered to be a gossypiboma that had been left behind during the earlier cholecystectomy. The body's reaction to the foreign body was seen to extend beyond the lamina propria and muscularis propria. Gossypiboma is an undesired and life-threatening but preventable surgical complication.

NOA (n = 23) and OA (n = 21) groups were created according to clinical and laboratory archival records. Testicular sperm extraction tissue sections were evaluated according to Johnsen's tubular biopsy scoring (JTBS) method. ERα and AR immunostaining results were evaluated semiquantitatively. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, and estradiol were analyzed. Serum FSH and LH concentrations were greater, and testosterone concentrations were lower than the normal values in the NOA group, whereas the OA group revealed normal hormonal values. Serum estradiol concentrations in groups were in the normal range. JTBSs were significantly lower in the NOA group. Decreased AR expression and increased ERα expression were observed in the NOA group compared to the OA group. This suggests that ERα and AR are expressed in Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and myoid cells and are required for normal testicular function. Decreased expression of the AR and increased expression of ERα in the testis may negatively affect spermatogenesis.

A considered approach to the complex, multidisciplinary management of infections that are caused by these pathogens is essential to optimising patient outcomes; however, management guidelines are either region-specific or require updating. In alignment with the One World-One Guideline initiative to incorporate regional differences, experts from diverse geographical regions analysed publications describing the epidemiology and management of the previously mentioned rare yeasts. This guideline summarises the consensus recommendations with regards to the diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with these rare yeast infections, with the intent of providing practical assistance in clinical decision making. Because there is less clinical experience of patients with rare yeast infections and studies on these patients were not randomised, nor were groups compared, most recommendations are not robust in their validation but represent insights by use of expert opinions and in-vitro susceptibility results.

Male rats were intraprostatically injected with LPS or saline, serving as control. Micturition parameters were examined in a metabolic cage 10 or 14 days later. Subsequently, to evaluate bladder function, cystometry was performed. Micturition cycles were induced by saline infusion and cholinergic and purinergic contractile responses were measured by intravenous injection with methacholine and ATP, respectively. Thereafter, the prostate and bladder were excised and assessed histopathologically for possible inflammatory changes. Metabolic cage experiments showed increased urinary frequency in rats with LPS-induced CP/CPPS. Cystometry showed a significant increase in the number of non-voiding contractions, longer voiding time and lower compliance in CP/CPPS animals compared to controls. Induction of CP/CPPS led to significantly reduced cholinergic and purinergic bladder contractile responses. Histopathological analysis demonstrated prostatic inflammation in CP/CPPS animals. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the extent or the grade of bladder inflammation. Prostate weight was not significantly different between the groups. The present study shows that prostate-to-bladder cross-sensitization can be triggered by an infectious focus in the prostate, giving rise to bladder overactivity and alterations in both afferent and efferent signalling.

This retrospective study included 48 patients with breast cancer (mean age 53.3 ± 11.7 years; IDC 89.6%; ILC 10.4%). In the comparison of both modalities, no statistical significance was obtained in terms of the pathological characteristics of the patients.

However, the analysis and visualization of mIF data can be complex and time-consuming. Here, we used tumor specimens from 93 patients with metastatic melanoma to develop and validate a mIF data analysis pipeline using established flow cytometry workflows (image cytometry). Unlike flow cytometry, spatial information from the TME was conserved at single-cell resolution. A spatial uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was constructed using the image cytometry output. Spatial UMAP subtraction analysis (survivors vs. nonsurvivors at 5 years) was used to identify topographic and coexpression signatures with positive or negative prognostic impact. Cell densities and proportions identified by image cytometry showed strong correlations when compared with those obtained using gold-standard, digital pathology software (R 2  > 0.8). The associated spatial UMAP highlighted ""immune neighborhoods"" and associated topographic immunoactive protein expression patterns. We found that PD-L1 and PD-1 expression intensity was spatially encoded-the highest PD-L1 expression intensity was observed on CD163 +  cells in neighborhoods with high CD8 +  cell density, and the highest PD-1 expression intensity was observed on CD8 +  cells in neighborhoods with dense arrangements of tumor cells. Spatial UMAP subtraction analysis revealed numerous spatial clusters associated with clinical outcome. The variables represented in the key clusters from the unsupervised UMAP analysis were validated using established, supervised approaches.

In the present study, the trace metal content (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) of two sessile crustaceans, 20 Mytilus galloprovincialis (mussel) and 20 Tapes decussatus (clam) in Faro and Ganzirri Lakes (Messina, Sicily, Italy) were analyzed. Haemolymph samples were taken on both molluscs in order to analyze the haemocyte population by flow cytometric analysis. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine significant differences for the essential and non-essential metallic elements concentrations in the lake waters and in the tissues of M. galloprovincialis and T. decussatus and for hemocyte populations R1 (halinocytes) and R2 (granulocytes). The results suggested that that in Faro Lake, the tissue Al, Cr and Pb levels in M. galloprovincialis were higher than those for T. decussatus, in contrast to Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd, which were higher in T. decussatus. Unpaired t-tests showed that there were significantly higher proportions of halinocytes in M. galloprovincialis versus T. decussatus for both Faro Lake (41.8 % vs. 24.3 %; P < 0.001) and Ganzirri Lake (43.0 % vs. 22.4 %; P < 0.001).

Normal colon tissue, hyperplastic polyps, histopathologically (HGD and LGD) staged tubular, tubulovillous and villous polyps and colon cancer paraffin tissue (FFPE) samples were used. Transcription factor genes (OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, MYC, NANOG, and REX1) and cell surface markers (CD133, LGR5), which are associated with embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and cancer stem cells, have been selected for measuring expression levels from the selected tissues. After isolation of total RNA from FFPE tissues, SCRGs expressions were measured by RT-qPCR method. SCRGs expression differences were detected in normal-adenoma-cancer progression. A significant increase was observed in the expression of LGR5 (p: 0.01) and PROM1 (p: 0.005) genes in villous HGD polyps, LGR5 (p: 0.003) gene in G1, and LGR5 (p: 0.0002) and MYC (p: 0.002) genes in G2 stage tumor tissues. When compared with each other, a significant increase in SCRGs expression is noticeable in the formation from adenoma to cancer tissues regarding malign phenotype. This study shows that the increase of SCRGs expressions occurs with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), villous features, and the malignant phenotype. Increased expression levels of LGR5, PROM1, KLF4, SOX2, and MYC in HGD and cancerous tissues support the malignant phenotype and the existence of cancer stem cells and demonstrate that they can be used to assess diagnosis and prognosis.

Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, ZeynepKamil Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, between Istanbul, TurkeyJanuary 2018 and June 2019. Thirty patients, who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)/unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO) and were in the proliferative phase of menstrual cycle,were included. The study population consisted of 20 patients (patient group) with an endometriomaand the control group consisted of 10 patients who were operated for benign gynecological pathologies.The ovarian and endometrial tissue specimens were collected from the archives. IHC staining was performed using decorin and VEGF.  Decorin analysis showed a significantly higher intensity of staining in both endometrial and ovarian tissues in control group than patient group. Patients with endometriosis had a lower intensity of staining of decorin and a higher intensity of staining of VEGF compared to control group. There was a negative, statistically significant concordance between VEGF and decorin staining of endometrial tissues of both groups (concordance rate -0.560, p=0.001). Therewas a negative, statistically significant concordance between VEGF and decorin staining of ovarian tissues of both groups (concordance rate -0.564, p<0.001). Angiogenesis plays a critical role in endometriosisand interaction between decorin and VEGF,which suggests that decorin may be a promising molecule for the treatment of endometriosis.

Correct identification of prostate tissue is helpful to define a precise RoI to be used in CAD systems in clinical practice during diagnostic imaging, radiotherapy and monitoring the progress of disease. Conditional GAN (cGAN), cycleGAN and U-Net models and their performances were studied for the detection and segmentation of prostate tissue in 3D multi-parametric MRI scans. These models were trained and evaluated on MRI data from 40 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Due to the limited amount of available training data, three augmentation schemes were proposed to artificially increase the training samples. These models were tested on a clinical dataset annotated for this study and on a public dataset (PROMISE12). The cGAN model outperformed the U-Net and cycleGAN predictions owing to the inclusion of paired image supervision.

Material and Methods:  The records of 23 patients treated between 2003 and 2018 were analyzed retrospectively.  Results:  Twelve patients were men and 11 were women; median (range) age was 55 (35-80). The principal diagnostic modality for the initial diagnosis was ultrasonography ( n :8), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ( n :13), and computed tomography (CT) ( n :2). At our institution, MRI was performed in 16 patients; the diagnosis was made with the available MRI and CT studies in five and two patients, respectively. In other words, the ultrasonography interpretations were not confirmed on MRI; in others, the MRI or CT examinations were of low quality or they had not been interpreted properly. Fifteen patients underwent surgery; the other patients received chemotherapy ( n :6) or chemoembolization ( n :2). The misdiagnosis caused a median (range) 10 (0-96) months delay in treatment. The final diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma in 12 patients, cholangiocarcinoma in four patients, metastatic mesenchymal tumor, metastasis of colon cancer, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, thoracic wall tumor, and metastatic tumor of unknown primary in one patient each.

The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic characteristics of PTX-3 in CHB patients and the relationship between PTX-3 levels and fibrosis. A total of 52 CHB patients and 40 healthy subjects were included in the study. All of the CHB patients underwent liver biopsy and were then scored using a Ishak histologic scoring system. Blood samples were collected to evaluate the PTX-3 levels. Of the subjects who participated in the study, 53% were female. PTX-3 levels were determined as 5.63ng/mL in the control group, and as 0.88ng/mL in the CHB patient group. PTX-3 levels were found to be 1.19ng/mL in stage 1, 0.89ng/mL in stage 2, 0.68ng/mL in stage 3 and 0.55ng/mL in stage 4. Of the CHB patients, 44.2% had significant fibrosis, while 55.7% were identified as not having significant fibrosis. PTX-3 values were 0.64 and 1.0ng/mL in patients with and without significant fibrosis, respectively. The cut-off value for PTX-3 in predicting the absence of significant fibrosis was estimated as 0.9ng/mL. CHB patients were found to have lower serum PTX-3 levels compared to the control group, and these levels decreased even further as the fibrosis stage progressed in these patients. In addition, the significant decrease in PTX-3 levels in patients with stage 1 fibrosis compared to the control group shows that PTX-3 can be used as a non-invasive marker for the early detection of fibrosis (p<0.001).",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34464321,NA,32,7,Turk J Gastroenterol

In a previous exploratory study of patients with bipolar I disorder, we found that a history of suicide attempts was associated with differences between winter and summer levels of solar insolation. The purpose of this study was to confirm this finding using international data from 42% more collection sites and 25% more countries. Data analyzed were from 71 prior and new collection sites in 40 countries at a wide range of latitudes. The analysis included 4876 patients with bipolar I disorder, 45% more data than previously analyzed. Of the patients, 1496 (30.7%) had a history of suicide attempt. Solar insolation data, the amount of the sun's electromagnetic energy striking the surface of the earth, was obtained for each onset location (479 locations in 64 countries). This analysis confirmed the results of the exploratory study with the same best model and slightly better statistical significance. There was a significant inverse association between a history of suicide attempts and the ratio of mean winter insolation to mean summer insolation (mean winter insolation/mean summer insolation). This ratio is largest near the equator which has little change in solar insolation over the year, and smallest near the poles where the winter insolation is very small compared to the summer insolation. Other variables in the model associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts were a history of alcohol or substance abuse, female gender, and younger birth cohort. The winter/summer insolation ratio was also replaced with the ratio of minimum mean monthly insolation to the maximum mean monthly insolation to accommodate insolation patterns in the tropics, and nearly identical results were found. All estimated coefficients were significant at p < 0.01. A large change in solar insolation, both between winter and summer and between the minimum and maximum monthly values, may increase the risk of suicide attempts in bipolar I disorder.

34466168,2021,8,NA,NA,Fusarium: more than a node or a foot-shaped basal cell.,NA,"Recent publications have argued that there are potentially serious consequences for researchers in recognising distinct genera in the terminal fusarioid clade of the family  Nectriaceae . Thus, an alternate hypothesis, namely a very broad concept of the genus  Fusarium  was proposed. In doing so, however, a significant body of data that supports distinct genera in  Nectriaceae  based on morphology, biology, and phylogeny is disregarded. A DNA phylogeny based on 19 orthologous protein-coding genes was presented to support a very broad concept of  Fusarium  at the F1 node in  Nectriaceae . Here, we demonstrate that re-analyses of this dataset show that all 19 genes support the F3 node that represents  Fusarium sensu stricto  as defined by  F. sambucinum  (sexual morph synonym  Gibberella pulicaris ). The backbone of the phylogeny is resolved by the concatenated alignment, but only six of the 19 genes fully support the F1 node, representing the broad circumscription of  Fusarium.  Furthermore, a re-analysis of the concatenated dataset revealed alternate topologies in different phylogenetic algorithms, highlighting the deep divergence and unresolved placement of various  Nectriaceae  lineages proposed as members of  Fusarium . Species of  Fusarium s. str.  are characterised by  Gibberella  sexual morphs, asexual morphs with thin- or thick-walled macroconidia that have variously shaped apical and basal cells, and trichothecene mycotoxin production, which separates them from other fusarioid genera. Here we show that the Wollenweber concept of  Fusarium  presently accounts for 20 segregate genera with clear-cut synapomorphic traits, and that fusarioid macroconidia represent a character that has been gained or lost multiple times throughout  Nectriaceae . Thus, the very broad circumscription of  Fusarium  is blurry and without apparent synapomorphies, and does not include all genera with fusarium-like macroconidia, which are spread throughout  Nectriaceae  ( e.g. ,  Cosmosporella ,  Macroconia ,  Microcera ). In this study four new genera are introduced, along with 18 new species and 16 new combinations. These names convey information about relationships, morphology, and ecological preference that would otherwise be lost in a broader definition of  Fusarium . To assist users to correctly identify fusarioid genera and species, we introduce a new online identification database, Fusarioid-ID, accessible at www.fusarium.org. The database comprises partial sequences from multiple genes commonly used to identify fusarioid taxa ( act1 ,  CaM ,  his3 ,  rpb1 ,  rpb2 ,  tef1 ,  tub2 , ITS, and LSU). In this paper, we also present a nomenclator of names that have been introduced in  Fusarium  up to January 2021 as well as their current status, types, and diagnostic DNA barcode data. In this study, researchers from 46 countries, representing taxonomists, plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, and students, strongly support the application and use of a more precisely delimited  Fusarium  (=  Gibberella ) concept to accommodate taxa from the robust monophyletic node F3 on the basis of a well-defined and unique combination of morphological and biochemical features. This F3 node includes, among others, species of the  F. fujikuroi, F. incarnatum-equiseti, F. oxysporum,  and  F. sambucinum  species complexes, but not species of  Bisifusarium  [ F. dimerum  species complex (SC)],  Cyanonectria  ( F. buxicola  SC),  Geejayessia  ( F. staphyleae  SC),  Neocosmospora  ( F. solani  SC) or  Rectifusarium  ( F. ventricosum  SC).

There was significant difference between the groups in terms of the percent area of MG dropout, MG density, meiboscore (P=0.020, 0.023, and 0.031 respectively), but no significant difference was observed in relation to MG quality (P=0.650). Although conjunctival impression cytology was of a higher grade in the patients with FMF according to Nelson's classification, no significant difference was observed between the groups (P=0.109). Although there was a decrease in the number of MGs in FMF patients, no significant deterioration was observed in conjunctival cytology. In these patients, tear film stability may deteriorate in particular. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of ocular surface disease secondary to MG dropout in patients with FMF.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34561094,NA,NA,NA,J Fr Ophtalmol
34478059,2021,9,NA,NA,Cushing's syndrome due to adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary origin: a case report and literature review.,NA,"In this article, we present a case of neuroendocrine neoplasm of unknown primary origin (UPO NEN), which is a rare cause of ectopic Cushing's syndrome (ECS) presenting numerous challenges, together with a literature review. A 43-year-old male patient presented with clinical features consistent with Cushing's syndrome (CS) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent hypercortisolemia. Despite a suspicious lesion on pituitary MRI, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling results were not compatible with Cushing's disease. Bilateral non-homogeneous opacities were observed in the thorax CT of the patient, who also had a history of COVID-19 infection, but no tumoral lesion was detected. When  68 Ga-SSTR PET/CT and  18 FDG-PET/CT were performed, multiple metastatic foci were detected in mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and the axial skeleton. Paratracheal-subcarinal lymph nodes were excised mediastinoscopically, and the diagnosis of NEN was made. Histopathological findings indicated that the possible origin was an atypical pulmonary carcinoid with a low Ki-67 labeling index. After controlling hypercortisolemia, a regimen of somatostatin analogs and capecitabine plus temozolomide was decided upon as treatment by a multidisciplinary council. This is a challenging case of UPO NEN presenting with ECS and confounding factors, such as previous infection and incidental lesions, during the diagnosis process. The case in question highlighted the fact that atypical pulmonary carcinoid with a low proliferation index may cause visible metastases even when radiologically undetectable.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34478059,NA,NA,NA,Hormones (Athens)

The incidental determination of significant pathologic lesions (SPL), that is precursor and malignant lesions, in RM specimens is rare. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of SPL in RM specimens, to evaluate the relationship between SPL and clinicopathological factors, and to examine the incidence of invasive breast carcinoma forming in the remaining breast tissue during the postoperative follow-up period developing in patients after RM operation. This retrospective study included 874 females who underwent RM operation between January 2012 and January 2021. Demographic, clinicopathological findings, and preoperative radiological findings were recorded. The patients were followed up after the RM operation in respect of the first occurrence of breast cancer. Invasive carcinoma was determined in 0.2% and SPL in 3.5% in RM. The probability of SPL determination was greater in patients aged ≥ 40 years and with ≥ 4 paraffin blocks (p=0.038, p=0.01, respectively). No statistically significant difference was found between patients with and without SPL in respect of radiological findings (p=0.35). The mean postoperative follow-up period was 53.6 months, and invasive carcinoma was diagnosed during follow-up in 0.2% of all patients (6.9% of the patients with SPL). Age over 40 years and an increased number of sampled blocks were found to be factors increasing the possibility of the determination of precursor and malignant lesions in RM specimens. RM could decrease the risk of the development of breast cancer. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

34474671,2021,9,NA,NA,Clinical impact of PD-L1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer patients with residual tumor burden after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,NA,"Studies on PD-L1 expression in breast cancer have gained importance in recent years, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our aim was to analyze the differential expression of PD-L1 to explore its correlation with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and patient survival. PD-L1 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically (Ventana SP263 clone kit) by staining tumor specimen. PD-L1 positivity was defined as membranous staining > 1%, > 5%, > 10%, and > 20% on either tumor cell (TC) and /or immune cell (IC). Fifty patients with locally advanced TNBC, who had a partial response to NACT, were included in the study. PD-L1 staining was observed in TCs in 25 patients (50%) and in ICs in 23 patients (46%) when PD-L1 > 1% was considered positive. Patients with PD-L1 positivity on ICs were more likely to respond to chemotherapy as measured by ""MD Anderson Cancer Center Residual Cancer Burden Index"" (14/22, 63.6% vs. 10/27, 37%, p = 0.064). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 46.3% and 51.4%, respectively. A high (> 20%) tumoral PD-L1 positivity was associated with a better DFS and DSS. Studies in the literature mostly focused on PD-L1 expression in inflammatory cells. However, our results suggest that patients with a high PD-L1 expression on TCs were more likely to have a better outcome. Since patients with residual tumor burden who express PD-L1 on TILs were more likely to respond to NACT, an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in addition to NACT would be an important option for TNBC with locally advanced disease.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34474671,NA,19,1,World J Surg Oncol

Here, we assessed the effects of hydrogen-rich water on different nickel-induced toxic responses (reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) of stress responses, histopathological changes) and cocoon production in earthworm model. Earthworms were randomly divided into two main groups: water (W) group including control (CW: ultrapure water), 10 (10W), 200 (200W), and 500 (500W), and hydrogen-rich ultrapure water (HRW) group including control (CHRW: hydrogen-rich ultrapure water), 10 (10HRW), 200 (200HRW), and 500 (500HRW) mg of nickel chloride kg -1  soil for 14 days. We found that cocoon production was less affected by the nickel exposure of earthworms in the 500HRW group compared to the 500W group. The ROS levels in 200HRW and 500HRW groups were less than that of 200W and 500W, respectively. The epithelial degeneration, epithelial necrosis, and necrosis in muscle fibers in tissues of earthworm were less damaged in 200HRW and 500HRW groups compared to 200W and 500W, respectively. HRW groups significantly reduced the expression of 8-OHdG induced by nickel exposure and inflammatory cytokine response including TNF-α. The study showed that hydrogen-rich water could alleviate the toxic effects of nickel-induced oxidative and inflammatory damages in earthworms. The HRW treatment known for its cheap and eco-friendly propertıes without any negative effects on the ecosystem can be used as a green method for alleviating the toxification effects of heavy metals in contaminated soil and increasing cocoon production of earthworms.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34482505,NA,NA,NA,Biol Trace Elem Res
34636053,2021,10,NA,NA,Tyrosol retards induction of fibrosis in rats.,NA,"Liver fibrosis, which still does not have a standard treatment due to its complex pathogenesis, is an important cause of mortality and morbidity. In this study, it was aimed to examine the possible protective and antifibrotic effects of tyrosol on the liver through histopathologic, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and molecular methods in rats with chronic liver damage induced by thioacetamide (TAA). The study was carried out in four groups with eight rats in each group. Created groups are, respectively, control, TAA, tyrosol and TAA +tyrosol. Chronic liver damage was induced in the TAA and TAA +tyrosol groups by the addition of TAA (200 mg/L) to drinking water. Tyrosol (20 mg/kg/b.w./daily) was administered by oral gavage to tyrosol and TAA +tyrosol groups for 10 weeks. The results of this study demonstrate that the consumption of tyrosol alleviated the histopathologic changes such as inflammation, degeneration, and especially fibrosis induced by TAA in the liver. In addition, administration of tyrosol significantly attenuated alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and apoptosis expression. Biochemically, it was determined that tyrosol increased glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase (GSH.Px), and catalase (CAT) activities and showed antioxidant efficacy by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Moreover, it reduced inflammation and fibrosis by decreasing gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1). Western blot analysis also revealed similar results in TGF-β1 expression. As a result, tyrosol suppressed fibrogenesis thanks to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects and showed an antifibrotic effect in the liver. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It is stated that tyrosol, a natural phenolic antioxidant found in olive oil, has neuroprotective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. In this study, tyrosol suppressed fibrogenesis thanks to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects and showed an antifibrotic effect in the liver. Olive oil has an important place in the Mediterranean diet, which reduces the incidence of chronic diseases. It is thought that the anti-fibrotic effect of tyrosol plays a role in this feature. As a result, it is thought that tyrosol can be used to prevent or slow down chronic liver diseases.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34636053,NA,NA,NA,J Food Biochem

When SH-SY5Y cells or primary neurons are exposed to hypoxia only, inhibition of FAS yields significantly enhanced cell injury. The pathophysiology of stroke, however, is not only restricted to hypoxia but also includes reoxygenation injury. Hence, an oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) model with subsequent reoxygenation in both SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons as well as a murine stroke model were used herein in order to study the role of FAS inhibition and its underlying mechanisms. SH-SY5Y cells and cortical neurons exposed to 10 h of OGD and 24 h of reoxygenation displayed prominent cell death when treated with the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor TOFA or the fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin. Such FAS inhibition reduced the reduction potential of these cells, as indicated by increased NADH 2   + /NAD +  ratios under both  in vitro  and  in vivo  stroke conditions. As observed in the OGD model, FAS inhibition also resulted in increased cell death in the stroke model. Stroke mice treated with cerulenin did not only display increased brain injury but also showed reduced neurological recovery during the observation period of 4 weeks. Interestingly, cerulenin treatment enhanced endothelial cell leakage, reduced transcellular electrical resistance (TER) of the endothelium and contributed to poststroke blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. The latter was a consequence of the activated NF-κB pathway, stimulating MMP-9 and ABCB1 transporter activity on the luminal side of the endothelium. In conclusion, FAS inhibition aggravated poststroke brain injury as consequence of BBB breakdown and NF-κB-dependent inflammation.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34483846,NA,15,NA,Front Cell Neurosci

Although recent advances in 3D printing fulfill the first requirement, the available synthetic polymers either are too rigid or show unfavorable surface and degradation profiles for the latter. In addition, natural polymers that are generally used as hydrogels lack the required mechanical stability to withstand the forces exerted during muscle contraction. Therefore, one of the most important challenges in the 3D printing of soft and elastic tissues such as skeletal muscle is the limitation of the availability of elastic, durable, and biodegradable biomaterials. Herein, we have synthesized novel, biocompatible and biodegradable, elastomeric, segmented polyurethane and polyurethaneurea (TPU) copolymers which are amenable for 3D printing and show high elasticity, low modulus, controlled biodegradability, and improved wettability, compared to conventional polycaprolactone (PCL) and PCL-based TPUs. The degradation profile of the 3D printed TPU scaffold was in line with the potential tissue integration and scaffold replacement process. Even though TPU attracts macrophages in 2D configuration, its 3D printed form showed limited activated macrophage adhesion and induced muscle-like structure formation by C2C12 mouse myoblasts  in vitro , while resulting in a significant increase in muscle regeneration  in vivo  in a tibialis anterior defect in a rat model. Effective muscle regeneration was confirmed with immunohistochemical assessment as well as evaluation of electrical activity produced by regenerated muscle by EMG analysis and its force generation via a custom-made force transducer. Micro-CT evaluation also revealed production of more muscle-like structures in the case of implantation of cell-laden 3D printed scaffolds. These results demonstrate that matching the tissue properties for a given application via use of tailor-made polymers can substantially contribute to the regenerative outcomes of 3D printed tissue engineering scaffolds.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34661388,NA,NA,NA,ACS Biomater Sci Eng

This study aims to assess the changes in eating habits, sleeping behaviour and physical activity status of final-year medical students (interns) whose education was suspended during the pandemic. In this cross-sectional epidemiological study, an online questionnaire was created. Interns were asked questions regarding socio-demographic status, eating habits, sleeping behaviour and physical activity status before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in dietary habits and sleep quality were evaluated under the guidance of Turkey Dietary Guidelines, Determination of Nutritional Status Report, Turkey National Nutrition and Health Survey and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine - Ankara, Turkey. Among 536 students, a total of 340 students (63·4 %) answered the questionnaire. After the beginning of lockdown, an increase in BMI was observed in both female (P = 0·002) and male students (P = 0·013). Students having healthy dietary habits increased by 18·8 % and unhealthy dietary habits decreased by 3·2 % during lockdown (P < 0·001). Overall, 63·2 % of students reported a decrease in physical activity, and 33·6 % reported a reduction in sleep quality, whereas 38·6 % reported an improvement in sleep quality. There was no significant difference in sleep quality between genders (P = 0·075).

Salvia species showed sensitivity with a zone diameter of 12-16 mm. Concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml to 16 mg/ml by the dilution method were used to determine the Minimum inhibited concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBK). The MIC values of the plants are mostly 0.5 mg/ml - 4 mg/ml and MBC values are between 0.5 mg/ml - 8 mg/ml. Antifungal activity findings are remarkable on the species and it has been observed to have very high effects especially on Candida parapsilosis. When the antioxidant research findings are examined; It was observed that Salvia marashica and Salvia caespitosa plants have approximately 75% antioxidant activity at 1 mg/ml, and findings mostly directly proportional between concentrations and antioxidant activity capacity were recorded. MCF-7 and HUVEC cell lines were used to investigate anticancer activity properties. In line with the findings, while the IC50 value of Salvia marashica on the MCF-7 Cell line was 0.125 mg/ml, it was 1.65 mg/ml in the HUVEC cell line, while the IC50 value of Salvia caespitosa on the MCF-7 Cell line was 0.115 mg/ml in the HUVEC Cell line.

The aim of this study was to review our clinical experience with pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with CTEPH secondary to IPV. Data were collected prospectively for consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary endarterectomy and had a diagnosis of IPV at or after surgery. We identified nine patients (six female, median age 48 (23-55) years) with IPV. The diagnosis was confirmed after histopathological examination of all surgical materials. The mean duration of disease before surgery was 88.0 ±70.2 months. Exercise-induced dyspnea was the presenting symptom in all patients. Pulmonary endarterectomy was bilateral in six patients and unilateral in three. No mortality was observed, however, one patient had pulmonary artery stenosis and stent implantation was performed. All patients received immunosuppressive therapies after surgery. Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased significantly from 30(19-67) mm Hg to 21(15-49) mm Hg after surgery (p <0.05). Pulmonary vascular resistance also improved significantly from 270 (160-1600) to 153 (94-548) dyn/s/cm -5  (p<0.05). After a median follow-up of 41 months, all but one patient had improved to the New York Heart Association functional class I.

To investigate whether microPVI and multifocality are directly related to each other. We retrospectively analyzed the relationships between microPVI, multifocality, and maximum tumor diameter (MTD) in prospectively collected transplanted HCC patients. HCCs with 1, 2, or ≥ 3 foci had more microPVI in larger than in smaller HCCs, with microPVI being present in 52.24% of single large foci. Conversely, microPVI patients had similar percentages of single and multifocal lesions. A linear regression model of MTD, showed microPVI best associated with MTD, with 2.49 as coefficient, whereas multifocality had a 0.83 coefficient. A logistic regression model of microPVI showed significant association with tumor multifocality, especially for small HCCs. Trends for microPVI and multifocality in relation to MTD revealed that both increased with MTD but more significantly for microPVI. Survival was similar in patients with small HCCs, with or without microPVI, but was significantly worse in microPVI patients with larger HCCs. No patient survival differences were found in relation to focality. MTD had stronger associations with microPVI than with multifocality. microPVI was associated with worse survival in patients with large HCCs, but survival was not impacted by number of tumor foci. microPVI and multifocality appear weakly related, having different behavior in relation to MTD and survival.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34506030,NA,NA,NA,J Gastrointest Surg

We conducted a retrospective international multi-institutional study to validate the current recommendations. Thirty-three (72%) nonseminomatous and 13 (28%) seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors were collected from 15 institutions in America, Europe, and Asia. Testicular tumor size ranged from 1.3 to 18.0 cm (mean: 6.1). Cases were classified as discontinuous involvement of spermatic cord soft tissue (n = 26), continuous cord involvement (n = 17), or cord lymphovascular invasion (n = 3). The mean follow-up was 39 months. Clinical stage for discontinuous involvement of spermatic cord soft-tissue patients was I (local disease) in 2/24 (8%), II (regional disease) in 6/24 (25%), and III (distant disease) in 16/24 (67%) cases; 16 (67%) patients presented with distant metastasis. Clinical stage for continuous cord involvement patients was I in 9/17 (53%), II in 4/17 (23%), and III in 4/17 (23%); 4 (23%) patients presented with distant metastasis. Disease progression was seen in 4 patients with discontinuous involvement of spermatic cord soft tissue and 5 with continuous cord-involvement (p = 0.699).

Serous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenoma are the most common benign epithelial tumors. Serous cystadenomas are ovarian tumors with the highest bilateral incidence. The coexistence of tumors with different histopathology in the ovaries is extremely rare and has only been reported in a few cases in the literature. We present a case of bilateral ovarian tumor that was diagnosed as serous and mucinous cystadenoma after laparoscopic surgery. A 45-year-old female patient was admitted to our center with swelling in the pelvic region and pain in the left lumbar region. US imaging showed a cystic lesion in the right adnexal area, 4x2cm in size, well-circumscribed, containing a few thin septa, and a low echo fluid content. A cystic lesion with 6x4cm sized multilocular, well-circumscribed, slightly high echo fluid content was observed in the left adnexal area. On CT, a complex cystic lesion measuring 6x4cm was observed in the left adnexal area, pushing the left ureter laterally and causing the hydroureter. In addition, a 4x2cm cystic lesion was observed in the right adnexal area and hydroureter was observed on the right side proximal to this lesion. Both lesions were removed by surgery. On histopathologic examination, the left-sided cystic lesion was diagnosed as mucinous cystadenoma, and the right-sided cystic lesion was diagnosed as serous cystadenoma.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies utilising tocilizumab in COVID-19 on different databases (PubMed/MEDLINE/Scopus) and preprint servers (medRxiv and SSRN) from inception until 20 July 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42020195690). Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed. The impact of tocilizumab and concomitant corticosteroid therapy or tocilizumab alone versus standard of care (SOC) on the death rate, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and bacterial infections were assessed. Thirty-nine studies with 15,531 patients (3657 cases versus 11,874 controls) were identified. Unadjusted estimates ( n  = 28) failed to demonstrate a protective effect of tocilizumab on survival (OR 0.74 ([95%CI 0.55-1.01],  p  = 0.057), mechanical ventilation prevention (OR 2.21 [95%CI 0.53-9.23],  p  = 0.277) or prevention of ICU admission (OR 3.79 [95%CI 0.38-37.34],  p  = 0.254). Considering studies with adjusted, estimated, tocilizumab use was associated with mortality rate reduction (HR 0.50 ([95%CI 0.38-0.64],  p  < 0.001) and prevention of ICU admission (OR 0.16 ([95%CI 0.06-0.43],  p  < 0.001).

It is known that mitochondria have a key role in the intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways of ischemia and reperfusion injury. In this respect, we pointed to explore the probable effects of isolated mitochondria transplantation from MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells), to alleviate ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal injury. Experiments were held on the 48 male Sprague Dawley rats. Groups were divided as Control (C1), I/R-Control (C2), Vehicle-1 (V1), Vehicle-2 (V2), Transplantation-1 (T1) and Transplantation-2 (T2) group. Unilaterally nephrectomy was performed in all groups. In the groups except the control, the left kidneys ischemized for 45 min and then reperfusion was carried out. According to the study groups, isolated mitochondria or vehicle infused into the renal cortex and rats were monitored for 48 h. Following that mentioned procedure, animals were sacrificed and biological samples were taken for physiological, histological and biochemical examinations. The results of present study show that mitochondrial transplantation promoted proliferation and regeneration of tubular cells after renal injury. Moreover, mitochondrial transplantation reduced mitochondrial dynamics-DRP-1 fission protein of tubular cells and reversed renal deficits. Mitochondrial transplantation diminished apoptotic markers including TUNEL and Caspase-3 levels in injured renal cells. Our results provide a direct link between mitochondria dysfunction and ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal injury and suggest a therapeutic effect of transplanting isolated mitochondria obtained from MSCs against renal injury.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34756876,NA,NA,NA,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol

The study included 1741 thyroid nodules with a final diagnosis in 1121 consecutive patients. The FNAB was recommended for all patients according to ATA guidelines and subsequently performed. The nodules were reclassified according to TI-RADS guidelines. Comparing nodules classified according to ATA and TI-RADS in terms of ultrasonography (US) features with the Bethesda cytological diagnosis classification System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology, 37.6% of the nodules classified in the high-risk category according to the ATA classification were found to be malignant cytology, 10.4% suspicious for malignancy, 4% non-diagnostic, 9.6% indeterminant cytology, and 38.4% benign. According to the TI-RADS risk category, 50% of those with high suspicion were malignant, 13.3% suspicious for malignancy cytology and 36.7% were benign.

This is a retrospective study collecting demographic, genetic, clinical and histological data of patients with genetically confirmed LGMDR6 including protein expression data from muscle biopsies. We contacted 128 pediatric and adult neuromuscular units around the world that reviewed genetic data of patients with a clinical diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder. We identified 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LGMDR6 of which 23 patients were included in this study. Eighty seven percent of the patients had consanguineous parents. Ninety one percent of the patients were symptomatic at the time of the analysis. Proximal muscle weakness of the upper and lower limbs was the most common presenting symptom. Distal muscle weakness was observed early over the course of the disease in 56.5% of the patients. Cardiac involvement was reported in 5 patients (21.7%) and 4 patients (17.4%) required non-invasive ventilation. Sixty percent of patients were wheelchair-bound since early teens (median age of 12.0 years old). Patients with absent expression of the sarcoglycan complex on muscle biopsy had a significant earlier onset of symptoms and an earlier age of loss of ambulation compared to patients with residual protein expression. This study confirmed that delta-sarcoglycanopathy is an ultra-rare neuromuscular condition and described the clinical and molecular characteristics of the largest yet-reported collected cohort of patients.

We aimed to evaluate the protective effect of oltipraz in testicular ischaemia/reperfusion damage. Twenty-eight Wistar-Albino rats were randomly divided into four groups. In ischaemia/reperfusion group, testicular torsion was executed, and orchiectomy was done 4 hr after detorsion with no treatment. Second group performed torsion; intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg oltipraz was applied 30 min before detorsion, and orchiectomy was performed 4 hr after detorsion. Third group applied torsion; intraperitoneal 150 mg/kg oltipraz was applied 30 min before detorsion, and orchiectomy was performed 4 hr after detorsion. Last one was the sham group. We evaluated tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and Johnsen testicular biopsy score. There was a significant decrease in TGF-β1, GSH and MDA values in oltipraz treatment groups compared with ischaemia/reperfusion group. Oltipraz treatment has significant protective effect in testicular ischaemia/reperfusion damage. However, more clinical studies are needed to demonstrate appropriate dose and its effects.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34514606,NA,NA,NA,Andrologia
34514570,2021,6,NA,NA,HHV-8 and EBV Positive Lymphoproliferative Disease: A Challenging Case.,NA,"Human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is linked to four lymphoproliferative diseases: primary effusion lymphoma, HHV-8 positive multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), HHV-8 positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma and HHV-8 positive germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder (GLPD). The diagnosis of HHV-8 associated lymphoproliferative diseases is quite challenging because each entity is rare and has a wide morphological spectrum. Our aim is to emphasize the overlapping histopathological features of MCD and GLPD as well as to underline the importance of clinicopathological correlation in case these two entities cannot be distinguished by pathological examination. We present here a case of an 82-year-old male patient who was examined for weight loss and multiple lymphadenopathy. Histopathological examination of the axillary lymph node revealed lymphoid follicle structures of varying shapes and sizes, including some atrophic germinal centers. Plasmablast-like cells were notable in some of these areas. HHV-8 and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positivity were noted in some of these cells and in a small number of cells in the mantle zone. Based on these findings; a diagnosis of ""HHV-8 and EBV positive lymphoproliferative disease"" was established. Since HHV-8 positive MCD and GLPD have similar histopathological features, it may not be possible to distinguish these two entities by histopathological examination only. At this point, the importance of clinicopathological correlation becomes more evident, especially in the determination of the treatment protocol to be applied to the patient.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34514570,NA,NA,NA,Turk Patoloji Derg

Testing has centered on driver genetic alterations involving the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements. The presence of these mutations is predictive of response to targeted therapies such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and ALK TKIs. However, there are substantial challenges for the implementation of biomarker testing, particularly in emerging countries. Understanding the barriers to testing in NSCLC will be key to improving molecular testing rates worldwide and patient outcomes as a result. In this article, we review  EGFR  mutations and  ALK  rearrangements as predictive biomarkers for NSCLC, discuss a selection of appropriate tests and review the literature with respect to the global uptake of  EGFR  and  ALK  testing. To help improve testing rates and unify procedures, we review our experiences with biomarker testing in China, South Korea, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and propose a set of recommendations that pathologists from emerging countries can apply to assist with the diagnosis of NSCLC.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34511936,NA,14,NA,Onco Targets Ther

In routine pathological practice, these markers are detected in tumor tissue using immunohistochemistry, which requires four immunohistochemical antibodies for each patient. We developed a new tissue microarray procedure using a punch device with a 6 mm core diameter. The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2 expression and the Ki-67 proliferation index of tumor tissues of 50 breast carcinoma patients had been determined using the conventional approach. We created three tissue microarray blocks, each containing samples from 14 main tumor tissues. One tissue microarray block was created with samples taken from eight main tumor tissues. Sections were cut from the four blocks and subjected to immunohistochemical staining; the original samples and the microarrays then were compared. We found significant agreement between estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 expression as well as Ki-67 proliferation index status of the original tumor tissues and the tissue microarray. Our tissue microarray technique using a single 6 mm core is a reliable and cost-effective method for determining estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER-2 status and Ki-67 proliferation index levels in patients with early breast carcinoma.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34519589,NA,NA,NA,Biotech Histochem

Some studies have claimed that even small (Sendai-negative) IPMNs frequently lead to PDAC. Recently, more refined pathologic definitions for mucin-lined cysts were provided in consensus manuscripts, but so far there is no systematic analysis regarding the frequency and clinicopathologic characteristics of IPMN-mimickers, i.e., pseudo-IPMNs. In this study, as the first step in establishing frequency, we performed a systematic review of the pathologic findings in 501 consecutive ordinary PDACs, which disclosed that 10% of PDACs had associated cysts ≥1 cm. While 31 (6.2%) of these were IPMN or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), 19 (3.8%) were other cyst types that mimicked IPMN (pseudo-IPMNs) per recent WHO/consensus criteria. As the second step of the study, we performed a comparative clinicopathologic analysis by also including our entire surgical pathology/consultation databases that was comprised of 60 IPMN-associated PDACs, 30 MCN-associated PDACs and 40 pseudo-IPMN-associated PDACs. We found that 84% of true IPMNs were pre-operatively recognized, whereas IPMN was considered in differential diagnosis of 33% of pseudo-IPMNs. Of the 40 pseudo-IPMNs, there were 15 secondary duct ectasias; 6 large-duct-type PDACs; 5 pseudocysts; 5 cystic tumor necrosis; 4 simple mucinous cysts; 3 groove pancreatitis-associated paraduodenal wall cysts; and 2 congenital cysts. Microscopically, pseudo-IPMNs had at least partial mucinous-lining mimicking IPMN but had smaller cystic (mean = 1.9 cm) and larger PDAC (mean = 3.8 cm) components compared to true IPMNs (cyst = 5.7 cm; PDAC = 2.0 cm). In summary, in this pathologically verified analysis that utilized refined criteria, 10% of PDACs were discovered to have cysts ≥1 cm, about two-thirds of which were IPMN/MCN but about one-third were pseudo-IPMNs. True IPMNs underlying the PDACs are often large and are already diagnosed pre-operatively as having an IPMN component, whereas only a third of the pseudo-IPMNs receive IPMN diagnosis by imaging and their cysts are smaller. At the histopathologic level, pseudo-IPMNs are highly prone to misdiagnosis as IPMN, which presumably accounts for much higher association of IPMNs with PDAC as reported in some studies. The subtle but salient characteristics of pseudo-IPMNs elucidated in this study should be combined with careful radiological/clinical correlation in order to exclude pseudo-IPMNs.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34518632,NA,NA,NA,Mod Pathol

Although the pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood, there is accumulating evidence for the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics affects mitochondrial function and bioenergetic efficiency in skeletal muscle cells of Megaconial CMD. Immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed impaired mitochondrial network, morphology, and localization in primary skeletal muscle cells of Megaconial CMD. The organelle disruption was specific only to skeletal muscle cells grown in culture. The expression levels of mitochondrial fission proteins (DRP1, MFF, FIS1) were found to be decreased significantly in both primary skeletal muscle cells and tissue sections of Megaconial CMD by Western blotting and/or immunofluorescence analysis. The metabolomic and fluxomic analysis, which were performed in Megaconial CMD for the first time, revealed decreased levels of phosphonucleotides, Krebs cycle intermediates, ATP, and altered energy metabolism pathways.

In this study, we have investigated for the first time in the literature the efficacy of injection of amniomax (AMX) into testicular parenchyma, which is a commercial medium of rat amniotic fluid, in preventing testicular IR damage related to testicular torsion. This study aims to evaluate whether or not amniomax has an effect on experimental IR damage in rat testes using biochemical and histopathological methods based on data in the literature. Even if testicular torsion is repaired surgically in early term injury because of de IR damage still occurs. Is it possible to reduce the ischemia reperfusion injury with amniotic fluid and increase the success of treatment? 40 male Wistar albino rats were included. Four groups were formed with 10 rats in each group: Sham, Ischemia/Reperfusion (IR), injection 1 min before detorsion (AMX-BD), injection 1 min after detorsion (AMX-AD). Total Oxidant Status (TOS) and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) were computed for oxidative stress, and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) levels were computed for the antioxidant system, for both serum and tissue. Necrosis and microcalcification levels were assessed in the evaluation of testicular histology. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. AMX-AD group has low necrosis degree than IR, Mean serum and tissue levels of TAS, TOS, and OSI parameters were respectively determined as; for TAS: 0.64 ± 0.11 and 0.96 ± 0.25 mmol Trolox Equivalent/L; for TOS: 6.71 ± 0.87 and 9.40 ± 1.03 μmol H 2 O 2  equivalent/L; for OSI: 11.94 ± 3.74 and 10.70 ± 4.23 arbitrary unit. Our study has investigated for the first time in the literature the efficacy of amniotic fluid in preventing testicular IR damage, and used amniomax (AMX) for this purpose. The limitation of our study may be the small number of rat in the groups. We think an injection after detorsion is more favorable considering that the AMX-AD group demonstrated significantly lower levels of TOS in serum and tissue and OSI in serum, and significantly higher serum levels of TAS compared to the AMX-BD group, as well as the fact that the morphological protection effect was only observed for injections performed immediately after detorsion.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34518124,NA,NA,NA,J Pediatr Urol

Although the entire GIS accounts for about 2% of tumors, recent research reveals that the incidence rate has increased. Given the increasing incidence in GI-NETs, more and more extensive research is needed on this subject. In this regard, the demographic and clinicopathological features of the patients diagnosed with GI-NET and their relationship with survival were investigated in the present study. Thirty-four patients diagnosed with GI-NETs between January 2009 and December 2019 at the Department of Gastroenterology, Inonu University Faculty of Medicine were analyzed retrospectively. Gender, age, tumor localization, metastasis status, tumor number, tumor diameter, tumor grade, Ki-67 index, and the relationships of these factors with overall survival were examined. Of the patients, 61.8% included in the study were male and 38.2% were female. The average age of the patients was 60.74 years. The most common tumor location was in the stomach (26.5%) and liver (26.5%). Apart from this, 17.6% of NETs were seen in the pancreas, 11.8% in the colon, 8.8% in the rectum, 5.9% in the small intestine, and 2.9% in the appendix. No significant relationship was observed between tumor location and gender (p = .326) and age (p = .641). The tumor diameter ranged from 0.2 cm to 13.91 cm, but the average tumor diameter was 3.84 cm. Solitary tumor was found in 51.5% of cases and multiple tumors in 48.5% of cases. The most common grade was Grade 1 with 41.2% of occurrence. The average of Ki-67 index was 18.36%. There was metastasis in 52.9% of cases. The rate of medical treatment was 48.5%. The median overall survival time of the patients was 23.1 months. In addition, 1-year overall survival was 74.9%, 2-year overall survival was 44.6%, and 5-year overall survival was 35.7%.

Its encoded protein promotes pre-mRNA splicing of many genes essential for development. Whereas individual phenotypic traits have previously been linked to erroneous splicing of SON target genes, the phenotypic spectrum and the pathogenicity of missense variants have not been further evaluated. We present the phenotypic abnormalities in 52 individuals, including 17 individuals who have not been reported before. In total, loss-of-function variants were detected in 49 individuals (de novo in 47, inheritance unknown in 2), and in 3, a missense variant was observed (2 de novo, 1 inheritance unknown). Phenotypic abnormalities, systematically collected and analyzed in Human Phenotype Ontology, were found in all organ systems. Significant inter-individual phenotypic variability was observed, even in individuals with the same recurrent variant (n = 13). SON haploinsufficiency was previously shown to lead to downregulation of downstream genes, contributing to specific phenotypic features. Similar functional analysis for one missense variant, however, suggests a different mechanism than for heterozygous loss-of-function. Although small in numbers and while pathogenicity of these variants is not certain, these data allow for speculation whether de novo missense variants cause ZTTK syndrome via another mechanism, or a separate overlapping syndrome. In conclusion, heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SON define a recognizable syndrome, ZTTK, associated with a broad, severe phenotypic spectrum, characterized by a large inter-individual variability.

Brain, liver, and kidney were collected from corvids ( n  = 34) between June 2019 and April 2020 and analyzed for the presence of WNV-specific RNA by quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, histopathologic and immunohistochemical examinations were also performed. Samples found to be positive by qRT-PCR were partially sequenced. WNV-specific RNA was detected in 8 of 34 corvids analyzed, which included 7 hooded crows ( Corvus cornix ) and 1 Eurasian magpie ( Pica pica ). Phylogenetic analysis based on partial WNV sequences from the 8 WNV-positive corvids identified in this study revealed that all sequences clustered within the WNV lineage-2; they were at least 97% homologues to WNV lineage-2 sequences from Slovakia, Italy, Czechia, Hungary, Senegal, Austria, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Germany. WNV sequences showed a divergence (87.94-94.46%) from sequences reported from Romania, Central African Republic, South Africa, Madagascar, Israel, and Cyprus, which clustered into a different clade of WNV lineage-2. Common histopathologic findings of WNV-positive corvids included lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis, myocarditis, and splenitis. The liver and heart were found to be the tissues most consistently positive for WNV-specific antigen by immunohistochemistry, followed by the kidney and brain. This study demonstrates for the first time the existence of WNV virus belonging to the genetic lineage-2 in resident corvids in Istanbul, Turkey. We hypothesize that the WNV strains circulating in Istanbul are possibly the result of a spillover event from Europe. Since WNV is a zoonotic pathogen transmitted by mosquito vectors, the emergence of WNV in Istanbul also poses a risk to humans and other susceptible animals in this densely populated city and needs to be addressed by animal and public health authorities.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34748405,NA,NA,NA,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis

The number of GECs was significantly higher in cases with chronic inactive superficial gastritis than cases with chronic active superficial gastritis (p = 0.033). We found that there was a decrease in the number of GECs in the corpus and fundus of the stomach in cases with gastric IM as a contribution to the literature. IM cause a decrease in the number of GECs in the gastric oxyntic glands. In addition, chronic active superficial gastritis is also associated with a decrease in the number of GECs.

Expression levels of Caspase-3, Caspase-6, Bax, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 alpha (IL1-α) and Bcl-2 proteins in muscle tissue were determined by western blotting method. Histopathological analyses were also performed on the muscle tissue. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) analyses were determined by a spectrophotometer. According to the obtained results, Bcl-2, TNF-α and IL1-α protein expression was increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while Caspase-3, Caspase-6 and Bax protein expression levels decreased in damage groups. MDA level increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while CAT and GSH levels increased with royal jelly application in royal jelly-given group in comparison to the flouride-exposed group. According to histopathological analysis results, edema and inflammatory cell formations were found in the injury groups, a tendency to decrease in these injuries was observed in the treatment groups. Based on these results, we can say that royal jelly has protective effects on muscle tissue against fluoride damage.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34528203,NA,NA,NA,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int

Synovial tissue samples obtained from synovial surgery from 30 RA (10 males, 20 females) and 92 OA (27 males, 65 females) patients with median age of 59 (range, 50 to 67) years were analyzed retrospectively between January 2010 and January 2019. The relationship between histopathological features and hormone receptor presence was analyzed. There was a meaningful relationship between histopathological parameters and RA and OA (p=0.01). The sex hormone receptor's presence was significantly higher in females with RA (p=0.01). Additionally, in the RA group, there was a remarkable relationship between ER and focal aggregates of lymphocytes (p=0.01), perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes (p=0.03), and diffuse infiltrates of lymphocytes (p=0.01). In the OA group, a significant relationship was observed between PR and subchondral inflammation (p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, it was observed that ER was an independent risk factor for focal aggregates of lymphocytes in RA group (odds ratio [OR]=1.51 [1.02-2.25], p=0.04). Besides, PR was found to be an independent risk factor for subchondral inflammation in OA group (OR=3.90 [1.28-11.80], p=0.02).

We aimed to evaluate the associations between metric variables, including the mesocolic mesentery area on the nodal harvest. All consecutive patients who underwent elective colectomy with a curative intention for colon adenocarcinoma were prospectively included. The metric variables included the lengths of resected intestinal segments, vascular pedicle, and colonic mesenteric area. The variables influencing the LN count and the correlation between the total LN count and the specimens' relevant metric measurements were analyzed. There were 46 patients with a median age of 64 years. The median count for total LNs was 22, and the LN positivity was 59.2%. There was an inadequate LN yield (<12) in 3 patients (6.1%). No significant associations were found between the adequacy of nodal harvest and the demographic, clinical, and tumoral features (P>0.05). There were significant positive correlations between total LN number and length of vascular pedicle and mesenteric area (r=0.576, P<0.001 and r=0.566, P<0.001).

A total of 47 patients with biopsy-proven primary IgAN, aged between 16 and 79 years, with a follow-up period ≥ 1 year or who showed progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) regardless the duration of follow-up were included. Study endpoint was the progression to ESKD. Serum Gd-IgA1 and advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels were measured using ELISA assays. Kidney biopsies were evaluated according to the Oxford MEST-C scoring, with C4d and CD68 staining. Seventeen patients (36%) experienced ESKD during a median follow-up time of 6 years (IQR 3.7-7.5).

34782991,2021,11,NA,NA,Tailored Therapeutic Doses of Dexmedetomidine in Evolving Neuroinflammation after Traumatic Brain Injury.,NA,"Understanding the secondary damage mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches. Neuroinflammation has a pivotal role in secondary brain injury after TBI. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complexes results in the secretion of proinflammatory mediators and, in addition, later in the response, microglial activation and migration of the peripheral immune cells into the injured brain are observed. Therefore, these components involved in the inflammatory process are becoming a new treatment target in TBI. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is an effective drug, widely used over the past few years in neurocritical care units and during surgical operations for sedation and analgesia, and has anti-inflammatory effects, which are shown in in vivo studies. The aim of this original research is to discuss the anti-inflammatory effects of different Dex doses over time in TBI. Brain injury was performed by using a weight-drop model. Half an hour after the trauma, intraperitoneal saline was injected into the control groups and 40 and 200 μg/kg of Dex were given to the drug groups. Neurological evaluations were performed with the modified Neurological Severity Score before being killed. Then, the mice were killed on the first or the third day after TBI and histopathologic (hematoxylin-eosin) and immunofluorescent (Iba1, NLRP3, interleukin-1β, and CD3) findings of the brain tissues were examined. Nonparametric data were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons, and the Mann-Whitney U-test was done for comparing two groups. The results are presented as mean ± standard error of mean. The results showed that low doses of Dex suppress NLRP3 and interleukin-1β in both terms. Additionally, high doses of Dex cause a remarkable decrease in the migration and motility of microglial cells and T cells in the late phase following TBI. Interestingly, the immune cells were influenced by only high-dose Dex in the late phase of TBI and it also improves neurologic outcome in the same period. In the mice head trauma model, different doses of Dex attenuate neuroinflammation by suppressing distinct components of the neuroinflammatory process in a different timecourse that contributes to neurologic recovery. These results suggest that Dex may be an appropriate choice for sedation and analgesia in patients with TBI.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34782991,NA,NA,NA,Neurocrit Care

This study aims to share the results of the Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 studies we performed in colon adenoma and colon adenocarcinoma cases in our hospital with the literature and contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Surgical materials of 40 colon adenocarcinomas and 40 colon adenomas were histopathologically re-evaluated. Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining were applied to these materials. Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 staining rates were compared in colon adenocarcinomas and adenomas. Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 staining rates were increased in colon adenocarcinoma cases compared to colon adenoma. There was a significant difference between the colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma case groups in terms of Cyclin D1 and Ki-67 staining scores.

The expression levels of genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of tumor tissue and adjacent intact lung tissue from 57 patients who underwent surgery for lung adenocarcinoma between 2011 and 2018 were determined by real-time PCR analysis. The expression levels of the DKK-1 in tumor tissue, especially in stage I-II tumor tissue, were significantly suppressed compared to those in normal tissue (p < 0.025). Whereas DKK-1 expression was suppressed in the tumor tissue of patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, expression of the SFRP-5 in these patients was significantly higher in tumor tissue than in normal tissue (p < 0.039). In our study, opposing regulation was found between the SFRP-5 and DKK-1, which are known to be extracellular antagonists of the Wnt signaling pathway. The SFRP-5 was found to have an oncogenic role in adenocarcinoma development.

Here, we describe the role of neutrophil elastase (NE) in ESWL-related rat kidney damage and investigate the protective effects of sivelestat, an inhibitor of NE, during the early and late phases. Four groups including control, ESWL alone, ESWL with sivelestat 50 mg/kg and ESWL with treatment of 100 mg/kg, each consisting of ten rats were created. Biochemical parameters of kidney function and damage and immunohistopathological findings were compared in the early (72 h after ESWL) and late (1 week after ESWL) periods between the groups. During the early period, serum and urine creatinine levels and urine kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels and the KIM-1/creatinine ratio increased in rats treated with ESWL compared to the control group. Furthermore, increased tissue inflammation, ductal dilatation and hemorrhage, and glomerular, tubular, and interstitial damage with increased NE staining were also detected in the ESWL treatment group. During the late phase, although urine KIM-1 levels remained stable at high levels, other parameters showed significant improvements. On the other hand, the administration of sivelestat 50 mg/kg decreased serum creatinine and urine KIM-1 and KIM-1/creatinine levels significantly in rats treated with ESWL, during the early and late periods. Significant decreases in tissue inflammation, tubular, and interstitial tissue damage were also observed during the early period.

The animals were divided into three groups: Control, AOM, and AOM + RA. Rats were fed a modified pellet diet (15.8% peanut oil was added to the standard diet) during the experimental period. Colon cancer was formed by applying 15 mg/kg AOM intraperitoneal once a week for 4 weeks in both the CRC group and AOM + RA group. Besides AOM, AOM + RA group received 5 mg/kg body weight RA orally every day during the study. The results showed that adenocarcinoma rates formed 87.5% of the AOM group. With treatment of RA, a reduction in the incidence of adenocarcinoma was observed in the AOM + RA group. The plasma MCP-1, IL-6, and TO levels were significantly higher, APN and TAS levels were significantly lower in the AOM group with respect to controls. In addition, there was a significant increase in TAS levels in the RA treatment group compared to the AOM group. These findings suggested that RA may be beneficial in preventing AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis formation.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34766714,NA,NA,NA,J Biochem Mol Toxicol

The peritumoral lymphocyte, plasma cell, neutrophil, eosinophil, and mast cell density were classified as none (0.24 mm2), mild (0-10/0.24 mm2), moderate (10-50/0.24 mm2), and severe (˃50/0.24 mm2) under 40x magnification and the relationship with prognostic factors was investigated. There was a statistically significant relationship between tumor capsule invasion (p=0.024) and surgical margin (p=0.049) with mast cell infiltration. A statistically significant relationship was observed between tumor capsule invasion (p=0.0001) and the postoperative disease-free period (p=0.0001) with neutrophil cell infiltration. The postoperative disease-free period of those with neutrophil infiltration was statistically significantly shorter than that of those with no infiltration. The tumor diameter of those with no plasma cells was statistically significantly smaller than that of patients with plasma cells (p=0.003).

In total, 179 cases of dysplastic nevi, with high and moderate degree of atypia, diagnosed and graded according to the previous criteria were reviewed by three pathologists. Then the observers graded the dysplastic nevi as low or high according to 2018 WHO criteria. Grading of dysplastic nevi was in complete agreement in 99 of 179 cases across three observers with a fair level of overall interobserver agreement (multirater Kfree: 0.40). The observers showed moderate to good agreement for most of the architectural features, except for criteria regarding focal continuous basal proliferation of melanocytes, density of non- nested junctional melanocytes and presence of dyscohesive nests of intraepidermal melanocytes. Whereas fair agreement was achieved for the cytological criteria. The 2018 WHO criteria for dysplastic nevus will ensure a common approach to diagnosis and grading of dysplastic nevi. However, histopathological criteria, such as cytological features and focal continuous basal proliferation of melanocytes, should be improved, so as to ensure a more accurate surgical approach and risk assessment.

Five (8.6%) cases (F/M=1/4, mean age: 63.6) were identified with granulomas.1/5 had history of neoadjuvant therapy. 4/5 patients presented with early stage (pT1/2). All were well-differentiated (Grade1-2/4). The mean number of tumor foci was 3.6, with a median size of 2.2 cm. All of them had advanced fibrosis. No difference was identified from cases without granulomas (n=53) in terms of prognosis and aforementioned parameters (p > 0.05). Granulomas were mainly concentrated in peripheral parts of the tumors. One case with nodule-in-nodule formation had granulomas lined along the border of the inner nodule. In 2 cases, granulomas were identified in steatohepatitic areas, while another had clear cell change. Only 1 had necrotizing granulomas, none with acid resistant bacilli. Two cases revealed concomitant granulomas in the adjacent liver parenchyma in addition to the tumor stroma. Except for one with a history of tuberculosis, none of the cases had a granulomatous disease. This is the largest case series of HCCs with granulomas by far. Our data revealed neither clinicopathologic and prognostic difference nor definite etiology related to granulomas.

What are the effects of lisinopril treatment on PAI-1 concentrations and the morphology and function of the ovaries in the letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rat model? This prospective randomized controlled animal study involved female Wistar albino rats. Twelve rats were assigned as controls (group I). In the study group (n = 48), letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) was administered for PCOS modelling for 9 weeks. After confirming disrupted oestrous cycles, the study group was randomized into two groups: group II (n = 24; letrozole only) and group III (n = 24; letrozole + lisinopril 15 mg/kg per day). After 12 weeks, each group was divided randomly into two. Biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses was performed in subgroups designated A, and fertilization rates were studied in subgroups designated B. Lisinopril treatment reduced the weight and area of the ovaries, the number and wall thickness of cystic follicles, and serum concentrations of LH and testosterone, relative to group II (P < 0.001). Circulating PAI-1 concentrations were significantly different among three groups (7.7 ± 0.9 ng/ml, 9.8 ± 0.7 ng/ml and 8.6 ± 0.7 ng/ml for groups IA, IIA and IIIA; P < 0.001). Pregnancy rates were 100%, 0% and 16.7% in groups IB, IIB and IIIB. In the letrozole-induced rodent PCOS model, lisinopril modifies the action of letrozole, possibly by inhibition of systemic and ovarian production of PAI-1.

34756079,2021,11,NA,NA,"Identification of Recent Tuberculosis Exposure Using QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, a Multicenter Study.",NA,"We investigated whether the difference of antigen tube 2 (TB2) minus antigen tube 1 (TB1) (TB2-TB1) of the QuantiFERON-TB gold plus test, which has been postulated as a surrogate for the CD8 +  T-cell response, could be useful in identifying recent tuberculosis (TB) exposure. We looked at the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) responses and differences in TB2 and TB1 tubes for 686 adults with QFT-plus positive test results. These results were compared among groups with high (368 TB contacts), low (229 patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [IMID]), and indeterminate (89 asylum seekers or people from abroad [ASPFA]) risks of recent TB exposure. A TB2-TB1 value >0.6 IU·ml -1  was deemed to indicate a true difference between tubes. In the whole cohort, 13.6%, 10.9%, and 11.2% of cases had a TB2>TB1 result in the contact, IMID, and ASPFA groups, respectively ( P  = 0.591). The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for an association between a TB2-TB1 result of >0.6 IU·ml -1  and risk of recent exposure versus contacts were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 1.61) for the IMID group and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.52) for the ASPFA group. In TB contact subgroups, 11.4%, 15.4%, and 17.7% with close, frequent, and sporadic contact had a TB2>TB1 result ( P  = 0.362). The aORs versus the close subgroup were 1.29 (95% CI, 0.63 to 2.62) for the frequent subgroup and 1.55 (95% CI, 0.67 to 3.60) for the sporadic subgroup. A TB2-TB1 difference of >0.6 IU·ml -1  was not associated with increased risk of recent TB exposure, which puts into question the clinical potential as a proxy marker for recently acquired TB infection.  IMPORTANCE  Contact tuberculosis tracing is essential to identify recently infected people, who therefore merit preventive treatment. However, there are no diagnostic tests that can determine whether the infection is a result of a recent exposure or not. It has been suggested that by using the QuantiFERON-TB gold plus, an interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay, a difference in IFN-γ production between the two antigen tubes (TB2 minus TB1) of >0.6 IU·ml -1  could serve as a proxy marker for recent infection. In this large multinational study, infected individuals could not be classified according to the risk of recent exposure based on differences in IFN-γ in TB1 and TB2 tubes that were higher than 0.6 IU·ml -1 . QuantiFERON-TB gold plus is not able to distinguish between recent and remotely acquired tuberculosis infection, and it should not be used for that purpose in contact tuberculosis tracing.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34756079,NA,NA,NA,Microbiol Spectr

Herein, we analyzed whether or not extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from such microglia are the biological mediators of these observations and which signaling pathways are involved in the process. Exposing bEnd.3 endothelial cells (ECs) and primary cortical neurons to OGD, the impact of EVs from OGD-preconditioned microglia on angiogenesis and neuronal apoptosis by the tube formation assay and TUNEL staining was assessed. Under these conditions, EV treatment stimulated both angiogenesis and tube formation in ECs and repressed neuronal cell injury. Characterizing microglia EVs by means of Western blot analysis and other techniques revealed these EVs to be rich in TGF-β1. The latter turned out to be a key compound for the therapeutic potential of microglia EVs, affecting the Smad2/3 pathway in both ECs and neurons. EV infusion in stroke mice confirmed the aforementioned in vitro results, demonstrating an activation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway within the ischemic brain. Furthermore, enriched TGF-β1 in EVs secreted from OGD-preconditioned microglia stimulated M2 polarization of residing microglia within the ischemic cerebral environment, which may contribute to a regulation of an early inflammatory response in postischemic hemispheres. These observations are not only interesting from the mechanistic point of view but have an immediate therapeutic implication as well, since stroke mice treated with such EVs displayed a better functional recovery in the behavioral test analyses. Hence, the present findings suggest a new way of action of EVs derived from OGD-preconditioned microglia by regulating the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway in order to promote tissue regeneration and neurological recovery in stroke mice.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34753919,NA,12,11,Cell Death Dis

Histopathological tumor types and subgroups, degree of Ki-67 expression and necrosis rates of the primary tumor, mediastinal lymph node (MLN) status and nodal stages were recorded. Among the two histologic tumor types (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) significant differences were present regarding metabolic parameters, Ki-67 index with higher values and kurtosis with lower values in the latter group. Textural heterogeneity was found to be higher in poorly differentiated tumors compared to moderately differentiated tumors in patients with adenocarcinoma. While Ki-67 index had significant correlations with metabolic parameters and kurtosis, tumor necrosis rate was only significantly correlated with textural features. By univariate and multivariate analyses of the imaging and histopathological factors examined, only gradient variance was significant predictive factor for the presence of MLN metastasis. Textural features had significant associations with histologic tumor types, degree of pathological differentiation, tumor proliferation and necrosis rates.

A total of 36 nasal polyp samples (10-nasal cavity, 10-maxillary sinus, and 16-ethmoid sinus) from the study group and 11 inferior turbinate samples from the control group were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, with monoclonal antibodies against CD68 (+) H-M.  Results   CD68 positivity was significantly higher than the control group in the subepithelial (SE) layer of the ethmoid sinus, and deep layers of nasal cavity, maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses. In SE and deep layers of ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, CD68 positivity was significantly higher than that of the epithelial layer. In the deep layer, histiocytic macrophages tended to gather around eosinophils.  Conclusion   The high numbers of CD68 (+) histiocytic macrophages mainly located in deep layer of lamina propria may be responsible for the phagocytosis of eosinophils within the polyp tissue. Therefore, it may be concluded that increased macrophages in nasal polyps do not trigger the growth of nasal polyps. Instead, they may serve to reduce the number of eosinophils in already-developed nasal polyps.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34745840,NA,82,6,J Neurol Surg B Skull Base

The results of immunohistochemical staining for D2-40, SMA and CD68 were noted semiquantitatively as 'negative','weak', moderate' or 'strong'. CD68 was found significantly lower in invasive tumor with peritumoral PASH-like stroma than those of tumor without PASH-like stroma. No significant differences were found for SMA and D2-40 between two groups.  Conclusions: Tumor-associated macrophages (CD68 positive) in tumor stroma have been demonstrated in association with tumor behavior in several studies. The presence of peritumoral PASH-like stroma, which is poorly staining for CD68, might be a morphological clue for the behavior of tumor.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34738581,NA,92,5,Acta Biomed

Aflatoxins' (AFs) are metabolites which especially have toxic effects on proteins, and are detoxified by the aflatoxin-B 1  aldehyde reductase (AFAR) pathway. In this pathway, the aldo-keto reductase family 7, member A2 (AKR7A2) enzyme is controlled by nucleic-related erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2) plays an active role. However, data on the efficacy of this critical pathway in broilers is limited.2. The aim of the following study was the changes in the expression levels of AKR7A2, Nrf2, and caspase-3, and the effects of  Nigella sativa  seeds (NS), thymoquinone (TMQ), and bentonite (BNT) on expression were investigated in broilers exposed to AFs.3. One-hundred broilers were divided into ten groups (control (CNT); AF; NS; TMQ; BNT; AF+TMQ; AF+NS; AF+BNT; AF+BNT+NS; AF+BNT+TMQ) and fed for 28 d. AF. TMQ, NS and BNT were added to diets at levels of 2 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, 50 g/kg and 10 g/kg respectively.4. The addition of AF to the diet decreased AKR7A2 and Nrf2 levels dramatically, but increased caspase-3 (P<0.01). TMQ, NS and BNT additions to the diet eliminated all negative effects caused by AF (P<0.01); and AKR7A2 and Nrf2 were further raised in TMQ and NS groups when compared to the control group. TMQ and NS showed a positive effect on detoxification parameters when given together with BNT.5. Supplementation with NS and TMQ enhanced AF detoxification  via  the AFAR pathway, by increasing AKR7A2 and Nrf2 levels, in addition to reducing hepatocyte apoptosis.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34738498,NA,NA,NA,Br Poult Sci

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the value of ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 2 (ATAD2) as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC. The expression of ATAD2 was tested in different HCC patient cohorts by immunohistochemistry and comparative transcriptional analysis. The co-expression of ATAD2 and proliferation markers was compared during liver regeneration and malignancy with different bioinformatics tools. The cellular effects of ATAD2 inactivation in liver malignancy was tested on cell cycle, apoptosis, and colony formation ability as well as tumor formation using RNA interference. The genes affected by ATAD2 inactivation in three different HCC cell lines were identified by global gene expression profiling and bioinformatics tools. ATAD2 overexpression is closely correlated with HCC tumor stage. There was gradual increase from dysplasia, well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated HCC, respectively. We also observed transient upregulation of ATAD2 expression during rat liver regeneration in parallel to changes in Ki-67 expression. ATAD2 knockdown resulted in apoptosis and decreased cell survival in vitro and decreased tumor formation in some HCC cell lines. However, three other HCC cell lines tested were not affected. Similarly, gene expression response to ATAD2 inactivation in different HCC cell lines was highly heterogeneous. ATAD2 is a potential proliferation marker for liver regeneration and HCC.

An Experimental Study by Genetic and Histopathological Predictors.,NA,"Several studies have reported differences in radiation toxicity between the sexes, but these differences have not been tested with respect to histopathology and genes. This animal study aimed to show an association between histopathological findings of radiation-induced lung toxicity and the genes ATM, SOD2, TGF-β1, XRCC1, XRCC3 and HHR2. In all, 120 animals were randomly divided into 2 control groups (male and female) and experimental groups comprising fifteen rats stratified by sex, radiotherapy (0 Gy vs. 10 Gy), and time to sacrifice (6, 12, and 24 weeks postirradiation). Histopathological evaluations for lung injury, namely, intra-alveolar edema, alveolar neutrophils, intra-alveolar erythrocytes, activated macrophages, intra-alveolar fibrosis, hyaline arteriosclerosis, and collapse were performed under a light microscope using a grid system; the evaluations were semi quantitatively scored. Then, the alveolar wall thickness was measured. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine gene expression differences in ATM, TGF-β1, XRCC1, XRCC3, SOD2 and HHR2L among the groups. Histopathological data showed that radiation-induced acute, subacute, and chronic lung toxicity were worse in male rats. The expression levels of the evaluated genes were significantly higher in females than males in the control group, but this difference was lost over time after radiotherapy. Less toxicity in females may be attributable to the fact that the expression of the evaluated genes was higher in normal lung tissue in females than in males and the changes in gene expression patterns in the postradiotherapy period played a protective role in females. Additional data related to pulmonary function, lung weights, imaging, or outcomes are needed to support this data that is based on histopathology alone.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34735567,NA,NA,NA,Radiat Res

As IECs serve as the primary barrier between underlying host immune cells, we reasoned that IEC-intrinsic antigen presentation may play a role in responses toward the microbiota. Mice with an IEC-intrinsic deletion of MHC class II (IEC ΔMHC class II ) are healthy but have fewer microbial-bound IgA, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and immune repertoire selection. This was associated with increased interindividual microbiota variation and altered proportions of two taxa in the ileum where MHC class II on IECs is highest. Intestinal mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) have similar MHC class II transcription but less surface MHC class II and are capable of acquiring MHC class II from IECs.

In each group, a partial capsulotomy, and synovectomy were performed in knee. After a partial capsulotomy and synovectomy were performed in each group, the collagenase group received intra-articular CCH of 0.008 mg in 0.1 mL saline solution while the control group received the equal volume of intra-articular saline solution alone. After 6 weeks of surgery, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and the following outcome measures were collected. Knee range of motion (ROM) was measured using with a goniometer under 20 g force. Adhesion formation was rated using the macroscopic visual scoring system after the knee joint was exposed through a lateral parapatellar approach. Histological evaluation was performed on samples including connective tissue and fibrotic adhesions, and fibroblast cell numbers were measured performed per square. Levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were assayed by ELISA from the intra-articular fluid. The macroscopic visual scoring system was significantly lower in the collagenasegroup (median = 1, range = 0-2) than in the control group (median = 2, range = 1-3)( < 0.001).ROMwas significantly higher in the collagenase group (102° ± 12.1°) than in the control group (77° ±8.94°) (P <0.001).

PTs are rare fibroepithelial neoplasms that have a morphologic spectrum ranging from benign to malignant. The differentiation of these entities is important as PTs are to be enucleated surgically. The purpose of this study was to calculate the T1 relaxation times of fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors and assess the potency of native T1 mapping for the differentiation of these tumors. This prospective study included 11 patients with a proven diagnosis of benign PT and 14 patients with a proven diagnosis of FA. All the patients underwent T1 mapping prior to conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Two radiologists, in consensus, selected lesion locations using freehand regions of interest from the DCE images and copied them onto T1 maps to acquire T1 relaxation times. The T1 relaxation times of the FA and PT groups were compared statistically. The mean T1 relaxation times were higher in the PT group compared to the FA group (p ≤ 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the T1 relaxation time being longer than 1,478 ms differentiated PTs from FAs with a sensitivity of 0.89, specificity of 1, and area under the curve value of 0.93. We found that benign PTs had longer relaxation times in T1 mapping compared to FAs.

A 27-year-old man with a recent upper respiratory system infection presented with difficulty in walking. His neurological examination revealed reduced muscle strength in both proximal and distal lower limb muscles without sensory and autonomic signs. Needle electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity and reduced recruitment of motor units in muscles innervated by multiple lumbo-sacral roots. Cerebrospinal examination showed increased protein levels with normal cell counts. While spinal MRI was normal, whole-body CT and PET examination showed disseminated lymph node enlargement. Anti-EBV viral capsid antigen and anti-nuclear antigen IgG but not IgM was positive, whereas EBV PCR was negative in blood. Analysis of inguinal lymph node biopsy showed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and EBV DNA. Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) antibody was found in serum but not in CSF. All clinical, imaging, and electrophysiological findings improved following steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. These findings suggested the acute involvement of lumbo-sacral spinal roots and/or motor neurons. Purely motor polyradiculopathy has been reported in both EBV-positive and LGI1 antibody-positive patients, and EBV infection is known to precede different autoimmune manifestations. Whether EBV infection may trigger LGI1 autoimmunity and cause involvement of spinal motor roots and/or motor neurons needs to be further studied.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34720961,NA,13,2,Case Rep Neurol

Both breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are controversial issues in the management of IBC. In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of SLNB in pathologically proven node-positive IBC patients. All patients with a histopathological diagnosis of IBC and biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes underwent systemic treatment. Patients with a complete clinical response in the axilla who underwent SLNB followed by standard axillary dissection were analyzed. The study consisted of 25 female patients. The identification rate (IR) and the false negativity rate (FNR) were 17/25 and 2/10, respectively. Overall, 9/25 and 7/25 of patients had a complete pathological response (pCR) in the breast and axilla after systemic treatment, respectively. Although the pCR in the axilla was 2/4 in nonluminal HER2-positive patients, the highest IR 4/4 and the lowest FNR 0/2 were determined in these patients. In triple-negative patients, however, the IR was 2/4 and the FNR was found to be 0/2. SLNB may be considered in selected axilla-downstaged IBC patients including patients with a pCR with HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors.

We aimed to compare the diagnostic performances of cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, and glucose in differentiating mucinous from non-mucinous neoplastic pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) and determine the best cut-off levels. Patients' data were evaluated retrospectively. 102 patients' PCLs were grouped as non-neoplastic ( n  = 25), non-mucinous neoplastic ( n  = 20), mucinous neoplastic ( n  = 47) and pancreatic adenocarcinomas with cystic degeneration ( n  = 10); and CEA, CA 19-9, and glucose levels were compared. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed, and the ideal cut-off values were determined. Cyst fluid CEA and CA 19-9, levels were significantly higher ( P  < 0.001,  P  < 0.001, respectively) and glucose levels were significantly lower ( P  = 0.001) in mucinous than in non-mucinous neoplastic PCLs.

Electrocautery was applied to damage the right and left vocal folds of a total of 12 New Zealand rabbits. PRP obtained from the rabbit's own blood was injected into the right vocal fold, and dexamethasone was injected into the left vocal fold. After 8 weeks, the experimental animals were euthanized, and the levels of inflammatory cell infiltration, vascularization, collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid (HA) were compared in histopathological evaluation. In statistical comparison of histopathological data obtained; in terms of plasma cell infiltration, vascularization, and edema parameters, statistically significant results were obtained in favor of the PRP group. Although the difference between collagen, elastin and HA, which are critical in vocal fold scar healing, was more positive in favor of PRP, no significant result was revealed in the statistical evaluation. PRP injection in rabbits with vocal fold damage reveals similar characteristics with dexamethasone injection in preventing scar formation.

This study is a retrospective analysis of cases diagnosed with CBP based on their demographic, clinical, radiological, surgical and immunohistochemical findings. Immunohistochemical examination results of Ki-67, S100, synaptophysin, chromogranin were retrieved from patient files. Then, the paraffin blocks of CBPs specimens, stained by PSMA-antibody by immunohistochemical methods were examined histopathologically. The number of patients operated on for CBP was 12 (four men and eight women). Ten out of 12 specimens were suitable for staining and histopathological examination. Capsular and/or vascular invasions of tumors were seen in complicated cases. Intratumoral vascular PSMA expression was seen in all specimens except one. Extratumoral vascular PSMA expression was not detected in any of the cases. Tumoral cell PSMA staining was seen in six of ten cases. We found higher intratumoral vascular expressions of PSMA nearly in all CBPs, but we could not assess the statistical significance because of the small number of specimens.

In treatment groups, Ura was administered intraperitoneally just before detorsion. Biochemical parameters (TAS, TOS, MDA, MPO, and SOD) and immunohistochemical (IL-1β, TNF-α, NF-κB, LC3B, and Caspase-3) analyzes were performed. In the T/D group, OSI and MPO levels were elevated significantly while TAS values decreased compared with the sham group. A significant difference occurred in the low dose treatment group in TAS and OSI levels compared with the T/D group. In the high dose treatment group, significant elevation in TAS but reduction in OSI and MDA levels were observed compared with the T/D group. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in IL-1β, TNF-α, NF-κB, LC3B, and caspase-3 immunopositivity in the T/D group, while Ura treatment decreased those parameters.

In the literature, there is no study comparing the histopathology of negative pathergy tests and positive pathergy tests in newly diagnosed Behcet's patients. The primary goal was to investigate the frequency of vasculitis, which is an important finding of Behcet's disease, in pathergy histopathology. The histopathology of patients with positive and negative pathergy tests revealed vasculitis or vasculopathy. In histopathology, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells in the perivascular area were counted and recorded as a percentage. Of the 88 Behcet's patients who participated in the study, 45 were female and 43 were male.

Phenotypically, this leads to growth and formation of hamartomas in several organs, including the brain. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are low-grade brain tumors commonly associated with TSC. Recently, gene expression studies provided evidence that the immune system, the MAPK pathway and extracellular matrix organization play an important role in SEGA development. However, the precise mechanisms behind the gene expression changes in SEGA are still largely unknown, providing a potential role for DNA methylation. We investigated the methylation profile of SEGAs using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (SEGAs n = 42, periventricular control n = 8). The SEGA methylation profile was enriched for the adaptive immune system, T cell activation, leukocyte mediated immunity, extracellular structure organization and the ERK1 & ERK2 cascade. More interestingly, we identified two subgroups in the SEGA methylation data and show that the differentially expressed genes between the two subgroups are related to the MAPK cascade and adaptive immune response. Overall, this study shows that the immune system, the MAPK pathway and extracellular matrix organization are also affected on DNA methylation level, suggesting that therapeutic intervention on DNA level could be useful for these specific pathways in SEGA. Moreover, we identified two subgroups in SEGA that seem to be driven by changes in the adaptive immune response and MAPK pathway and could potentially hold predictive information on target treatment response.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34709498,NA,NA,NA,Cell Mol Neurobiol

Between 2015-2020, patients with pathological complete response who were operated on after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and sent to our clinic for radiotherapy were evaluated. The median age of the patients was 51 years. The most common histological type was invasive ductal cancer. The number of pathological complete response patients was 74 (28%), and the number of non-pathological complete response patients was 188 (72%). Patients with pathological complete response had a smaller tumor diameter than the non-pathological complete response group (p=0.001). For pathological complete response, T1 stage, N1 stage, NG 3, Ki-67 >20%, negative estrogen receptor, negative progesterone receptor, positive Cerb-B2, and adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy were statistically significant (p<0.05). Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, stage T1-T2 (p=0.036), LN0-1 (p=0.026), Cerb-B2 positivity (p=0.025), and an initial nuclear grade of three (p=0.001) were found to be the factors affecting pathological complete response. With neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the size of locally advanced tumors decreases, allowing breast conserving surgery. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy response can be used as an early indicator of the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Today, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also used for patients with early-stage, operable breast cancer because it has been shown in many studies that reaching pathological complete response is associated with positive long-term results.

Results showed that in a population previously exposed to the effects of war, severity of PTSD symptoms was positively related to perceived stress, and loneliness during the pandemic significantly mediated this relationship. Intensity of exposure to war trauma reminders was associated with higher levels of PTSD symptom severity. Higher severity of PTSD symptoms was related to forced displacement during the war.

This study investigates the protective effect of PCA on tissue damage and kidney function in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity (GIN). Thirty-five rats were separated into five groups and each group contained seven animals: control group, ethanol group, GM group, PCA group, and GM + PCA group. At the end of the seven-day treatment, the rats were sacrificed after blood and kidney tissue samples were taken. While serum urea, creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels increased significantly in the GM group compared to the control, they showed a significant decrease in the GM + PCA group compared to the GM. Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly increased in the GM group compared to the control. While the tissue total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) values of the GM group were significantly higher than the control, they showed a significant decrease in the GM + PCA group compared to the GM. In the histopathological examination, significant tubular necrosis and tubulointerstitial inflammation were detected in the proximal tubules in the GM group compared to the control, while a significant decrease was observed in the severity of these findings in the GM + PCA group compared to the GM. This study shows that PCA has biochemical and histopathological ameliorating effects on GIN in the rat model.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34702126,NA,NA,NA,Drug Chem Toxicol

In addition, this work aimed to identify key decision factors that practitioners consider in their decision to retreat or not a patient with hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation. Practitioners have been invited by e-mail to participate in an online exercise on viscosupplementation retreatment. They received a fictional patient case at random among a set of predefined fictional cases. The platform asked the practitioner if he/she would retreat the patient with viscosupplementation or not. To take a decision, the practitioner could select questions among a list of predefined questions. Among them, some were related to criteria used in the EUROVISCO decision tree and others served as confounding factors. A total of 506 practitioners participated to the exercise, of which 399 gave their decision about the case assigned to them by the platform. The observed agreement between practitioner decisions and EUROVISCO recommendations was 58.89 ± 4.95% (95% confidence interval [CI]). Overall, the decision to retreat was taken in 47.87% of the cases, while the EUROVISCO guidelines follow-up would have led to 55.89% retreatment for the same cases ( P  = 0.03).

High dose, long-term Interferon-α (IFNα) is the approved treatment and may ameliorate course. We evaluated long-term histological outcomes of CDH patients treated with IFNα.  Method:  Histologically proved non-cirrhotic CDH patients treated with high dose IFNα for at least 1 year were grouped as cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic at the end of treatment. Non-cirrhotic patients had also post-treatment liver biopsies. Patients were grouped as histologically responsive and non-responsive regarding fibrosis status. Histological, virological and biochemical courses were analyzed.  Results:  48 patients were treated with IFNα (conventional and/or pegylated) for median 24 months with a post-treatment follow-up of 5 years. During the follow-up, cirrhosis developed in 24 patients, 5 of whom were decompensated. There was no difference between pre- and post-treatment fibrosis scores of 24 non-cirrhotic patients at the end of follow-up. Among patients; 13% (n:6) had decreased, 21%(n:10) had steady and 16% (n:8) had increased fibrosis scores. Persistent viral response (PVR) was achieved in 16 patients (33%). 20% of entire group was histologically responsive (decreasing or steady fibrosis scores with improved necro-inflammatory score) while near 80% had histological progression/cirrhosis. PVR was significantly associated with histological response.  Conclusions : Long-term natural course of patients who were treated with high dose IFNα for at least one year was evaluated clinically and histologically. Despite the association of PVR with histological response, IFNα treatment didn't change the natural course of CDH, clinical and histological progression continued in two-thirds of the cases despite treatment.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34694876,NA,NA,NA,Antimicrob Agents Chemother

34693844,2021,10,NA,NA,Nebivolol alleviates liver damage caused by methotrexate via AKT1/Hif1α/eNOS signaling.,NA,"Despite the wide clinical indications, methotrexate (MTX) use is limited because of serious side effects including liver toxicity. MTX was shown to cause tissue damage by mainly oxidative stress and also inflammation and apoptosis. Thus, Nebivolol (NEB) which has antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties were thought to be effective against MTX-induced injury. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of NEB on MTX-induced liver toxicity via AKT/Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Alpha (HIF1α)/Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) signaling pathways. Rats were divided into three groups as control, MTX, and NEB. A single dose of MTX (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was given to the rats on the first day of the experiment and NEB (10 mg/kg, daily by oral gavage) was given to the treatment group for a week. At the end of the experiment, bloods were taken for aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (T-BIL) analyses. Liver tissues were harvested for biochemical (total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS), genetic (PCR analyses for AKT1, eNOS, and HIF1a), and histological (Hemotoxylin-Eosin, Masson Trichome, Periodic Acid Schiff-Asien Blue, reticulin for histological, and CD3 for immunohistochemical staining) analyses. MTX increased the levels of TOS values, AST, ALT, T-BIL levels and decreased the expressions of AKT/HIF1α/eNOS. NEB treatment reversed all these changes markedly via decreasing inflammation by nitric oxid (NO) production. In conclusion, NEB treatment significantly preserves the liver by decreasing oxidant levels and inflammatory parameters through HIF1α/eNOS signaling. Due to the antioxidant properties of NEB, it can be used in other liver injury models sharing the same pathway.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34693844,NA,NA,NA,Drug Chem Toxicol

Athletes (n = 12,526, comprising 13% world class, 21% international, 36% national, 24% state, and 6% recreational) completed an online survey that was available from 17 May to 5 July 2020 and explored their training behaviors (training knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, and practices), including specific questions on their training intensity, frequency, and session duration before and during lockdown (March-June 2020). Overall, 85% of athletes wanted to ""maintain training,"" and 79% disagreed with the statement that it is ""okay to not train during lockdown,"" with a greater prevalence for both in higher-level athletes. In total, 60% of athletes considered ""coaching by correspondence (remote coaching)"" to be sufficient (highest amongst world-class athletes). During lockdown, < 40% were able to maintain sport-specific training (e.g., long endurance [39%], interval training [35%], weightlifting [33%], plyometric exercise [30%]) at pre-lockdown levels (higher among world-class, international, and national athletes), with most (83%) training for ""general fitness and health maintenance"" during lockdown. Athletes trained alone (80%) and focused on bodyweight (65%) and cardiovascular (59%) exercise/training during lockdown. Compared with before lockdown, most athletes reported reduced training frequency (from between five and seven sessions per week to four or fewer), shorter training sessions (from ≥ 60 to < 60 min), and lower sport-specific intensity (~ 38% reduction), irrespective of athlete classification. COVID-19-related lockdowns saw marked reductions in athletic training specificity, intensity, frequency, and duration, with notable within-sample differences (by athlete classification). Higher classification athletes had the strongest desire to ""maintain"" training and the greatest opposition to ""not training"" during lockdowns. These higher classification athletes retained training specificity to a greater degree than others, probably because of preferential access to limited training resources. More higher classification athletes considered ""coaching by correspondence"" as sufficient than did lower classification athletes. These lockdown-mediated changes in training were not conducive to maintenance or progression of athletes' physical capacities and were also likely detrimental to athletes' mental health. These data can be used by policy makers, athletes, and their multidisciplinary teams to modulate their practice, with a degree of individualization, in the current and continued pandemic-related scenario. Furthermore, the data may drive training-related educational resources for athletes and their multidisciplinary teams. Such upskilling would provide athletes with evidence to inform their training modifications in response to germane situations (e.g., COVID related, injury, and illness).",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34687439,NA,NA,NA,Sports Med

However, the impact of HPV-status on the expression of VEGFR2 in OPSCC has not yet been investigated, although HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 induce VEGF-expression. In a series of 56 OPSCC with known HPV-status, VEGFR2 expression patterns were analyzed both in blood vessels from tumor-free and tumor-containing regions and within tumor cells by immunohistochemistry using densitometry. Differences in subcellular colocalization of VEGFR2 with endothelial, tumor and stem cell markers were determined by double-immunofluorescence imaging. Immunohistochemical results were correlated with clinicopathological data. HPV-infection induces significant downregulation of VEGFR2 in cancer cells compared to HPV-negative tumor cells ( p  = 0.012). However, with respect to blood vessel supply, the intensity of VEGFR2 staining differed only in HPV-positive OPSCC and was upregulated in the blood vessels of tumor-containing regions ( p  < 0.0001). These results may suggest different routes of VEGFR2 signaling depending on the HPV-status of the OPSCC. While in HPV-positive OPSCC, VEGFR2 might be associated with increased angiogenesis, in HPV-negative tumors, an autocrine loop might regulate tumor cell survival and invasion.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34680369,NA,13,20,Cancers (Basel)

They affect women of all ages, but due to their low incidence and the potential clinical inexperience in management, there can be a delay in diagnosis, leading to a poor prognosis. The underlying causes for these tumors are varied, but generally, the tumors arise due to alterations in gene/protein expression in cellular processes that regulate normal proliferation and its checkpoints. Dysregulation of the cellular processes that lead to cancer includes gene mutations, epimutations, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulation, posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are defined as transcribed RNA molecules, more than 200 nucleotides in length which are not translated into proteins. They regulate gene expression through several mechanisms and therefore add another level of complexity to the regulatory mechanisms affecting tumor development. Since few studies have been performed on ROCs, in this review we summarize the mechanisms of action of lncRNA in OC, with an emphasis on ROCs.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34680193,NA,13,20,Cancers (Basel)

Recurrence is a risk factor for malignant transformation. We aimed to examine the prognostic significance of four biomarkers related to cell proliferation: p53, p63, podoplanin (PDPN) and Ki-67 in predicting recurrence. Formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded specimens from excised OL (n = 73, 33 recurrent; 40 non-recurrent) were collected in a prospective study. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualise expression of p53, p63, PDPN and Ki-67. Image analysis software was used for quantification of p53-, p63- and Ki-67-expressing cells, while PDPN was analysed visually. The expression of all four proteins were higher in recurrent compared with non-recurrent OL, only expression of p53 was statistically significant. In uni- and multivariable Cox regression analyses of individual markers, expression of p63 was significantly associated with higher recurrence risk (p = 0.047). OL with a combined high expression of both p53 and p63 had a significantly higher risk to recur [Log Rank, p = 0.036; multivariate Cox, HR: 2.48 (1.13-5.44; p = 0.024)].

Conventional radiologic methods make only a limited contribution to exact diagnosis, and texture analysis data increase the diagnostic performance. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of texture analysis of US images (TAUI) of PTs in order to discriminate between BPTs and BoPTs-MPTs.  The number of patients was 63 (41 BPTs, 12 BoPTs, and 10 MPTs). Patients were divided into two groups (Group 1-BPT, Group 2-BoPT/MPT). TAUI with LIFEx software was performed retrospectively. An independent machine learning approach, MATLAB R2020a (Math- Works, Natick, Massachusetts) was used with the dataset with p < 0.004. Two machine learning approaches were used to build prediction models for differentiating between Group 1 and Group 2. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of statistically significant texture data between phyllodes subgroups.  In TAUI, 10 statistically significant second order texture values were identified as significant factors capable of differentiating among the two groups (p < 0.05). Both of the models of our dataset make a diagnostic contribution to the discrimination between BopTs-MPTs and BPTs.  In PTs, US is the main diagnostic method. Adding machine learning-based TAUI to conventional US findings can provide optimal diagnosis, thereby helping to choose the correct surgical method. Consequently, decreased local recurrence rates can be achieved.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34674218,NA,NA,NA,Ultraschall Med

The study includes 85 patients who were diagnosed in our center between 2018 and 2019 and having surgical specimens were included in the study. Data of the cases, such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 status, silver in situ hybridization (SISH) evaluation results, age distribution, histopathological findings were recorded. We investigated the relationship between age, grade, tumor size, lymph node metastases and ER, PR, and HER2. However, there was not a significant association between ER, PR, and HER2 and age, tumor size, lymph node metastases (P > 0.05). On the other hand, we found a significant association between grades and ER (P = 0.02) and PR (P = 0.004), but not between grades and HER2 (P > 0.05). High-grade tumors were tumors with the lowest ER, PR positivity rate. Considering the four subtypes, cases aged above 45 years were at most double hormone receptor-positive (75%) and ER-positive/PR-negative (56%), respectively (P < 0.001). High-grade tumors were mostly double hormone receptor-negative and at least double hormone receptor positive. The ER-positive/PR-negative subtype was between these two groups (P < 0.001). The increased tumor size (T3) and increased metastatic lymph node number (N2 and N3) were observed at least in the ER-positive/PR-negative subtype. The majority of cases are in the older age group and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common tumor type. Older cases are most frequently double hormone receptor-positive and ER-positive/PR-negative, respectively. The ER, PR positivity rate is low in high-grade tumors. ER-positive/PR-negative tumors are of a higher grade than double hormone receptor-positive tumors, but they are of a lower grade than double hormone receptor-negative tumors. The increased tumor size and increased lymph node metastasis number are at most in the double hormone negative subtype and at least in the ER-positive/PR-negative subtype. The ER-negative/PR-positive subtype is observed very rarely, which raises the question of whether ER-negative/PR-positive tumors really exist.

Tumor proliferation activity should be determined for the differentiation of grades II and III tumors. In difficult cases, an auxiliary parameter is required. Nucleostemin (NS) is nucleolar Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein 3. It has important roles in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, self-renewal, and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated whether the level of NS expression is different in grades II and III astrocytomas. Adults diagnosed with grades II and III astrocytomas were included in the study. Paraffin blocks that best reflected tumor morphology were studied via immunohistochemical staining for NS. Only nuclear staining was evaluated; cytoplasmic staining was not considered. Fisher's exact test, continuity corrections, and Pearson's Chi-square tests were used in the crosstabs. The survival analysis was based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Only 20% (6/30) of grade II tumors had high intensity staining, while 54,2% (13/24) of grade III tumors had high staining intensity. NS was significantly more intense in grade III tumors than grade II tumors. In cases with high NS expression, survival was significantly shorter than the cases with low expression. NS is significantly higher expressed in grade III tumors than grade II tumors.

Yet, even with MRI-guided biopsy 15%-35% of high-risk lesions (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] 4 and 5) are histologically benign. It is unclear if these false positives are due to diagnostic/sampling errors or pathophysiological alterations. To better understand this, we tested histologically benign PI-RAD 4 and 5 lesions for common malignant epigenetic alterations. MRI-guided in-bore biopsy samples were collected from 45 patients with PI-RADS 4 (n = 31) or 5 (n = 14) lesions. Patients had a median clinical follow-up of 3.8 years. High-risk mpMRI patients were grouped based on their histology into biopsy positive for tumor (BPT; n = 28) or biopsy negative for tumor (BNT; n = 17). From these biopsy samples, DNA methylation of well-known tumor suppressor genes (APC, GSTP1, and RARβ2) was quantified. Similar to previous work we observed high rates of promoter methylation at GSTP1 (92.7%), RARβ2 (57.3%), and APC (37.8%) in malignant BPT samples but no methylation in benign TURP chips. Interestingly, similar to the malignant samples the BNT biopsies also had increased methylation at the promoter of GSTP1 (78.8%) and RARβ2 (34.6%). However, despite these epigenetic alterations none of these BNT patients developed prostate cancer, and those who underwent repeat mpMRI (n = 8) demonstrated either radiological regression or stability.

Mucormycosis is a rare, lifethreatening invasive fungal infection. In this report, two cases who developed rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis shortly after having COVID-19 infection were presented. The first case was a 68-year old woman who admitted to our clinic with orbital cellulitis in her left eye and had a known diagnosis of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia 40 days ago, stayed in the intensive care unit for a long time, and received pulse steroid (1000 mg methylprednisolone), interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitor (anakinra) and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatments together with antiviral therapy during this period. The second case was a 63-year-old male patient with known diabetes mellitus, hypertension and retinitis pigmentosa, with a history of hospitalization in the intensive care unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia 20 days ago and received pulse steroid therapy during this period. He admitted to our clinic with the complaints of droopy right eyelid, swelling, nausea and vomiting. In both cases, paranasal sinus tomography findings were consistent with invasive sinusitis. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed immediately in less than 16 hours from the first admission in both cases. Histopathological examination of the both cases revealed results consistent with mucormycosis. Mucorales spp. was isolated in sinus tissue culture of the second case taken during the operation. Both of the patients received liposomal amphotericin B. First case died on the 19th day of the treatment. Second case was discharged with full recovery after nine weeks of treatment.

Methods:  Ninety-six newborn C57BL/6J mice were included. Eight groups were randomized, each including 12 mice. Two negative control groups were kept in room air: the first without any injection and the second received intravitreal (IV) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is the solvent we used. The OIR groups were exposed to 75% ± 2% oxygen from postnatal days (PD) 7 to 12. On PD 12, the mice were randomly assigned to 6 groups: 2 OIR control groups (1 received no injection, 1 received IV-DMSO), 2 IV-apigenin groups (10 and 20 μg/mL), and 2 intraperitoneal (IP)-apigenin groups (10 and 20 mg/kg). We quantified retinal endothelial cell proliferation by counting neovascular tufts in cross-sections and examined histological and ultrastructural changes through light and electron microscopy. We evaluated apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL).  Results:  We detected a significant increase in endothelial cell proliferation in the OIR groups. Groups receiving apigenin, both IP and IV, had significant decreases in endothelial cells, atypical mitochondrion count, and apoptotic cells compared with the groups receiving no injections. None of the apigenin-injected groups revealed cystic degeneration or cell loss.  Conclusions:  Apigenin suppresses neovascularization, has antiapoptotic and antioxidative effects in an OIR mouse model, and can be considered a promising agent for treating OND.

Patients with early-stage IDBC who underwent  18 F-FDG PET/CT scan for staging were included in this retrospective study. The status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, Ki-67 proliferative index, and grades of tumors were recorded. The conventional metabolic parameters [maximum standard uptake value (SUV max ) and average standard uptake value] and volume-based parameters [metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis] of the primary tumor were obtained from the  18 F-FDG PET/CT images. The associations and correlations between the  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters and histopathological features were assessed. One hundred forty-three patients were included.  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters, other than MTV, were significantly associated with the ER and PR status and Ki-67 index, while T-staging was significantly associated with all  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters. In the axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement, no significant difference was found in the  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters. In terms of the pathological stage, a significant difference was found in all  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters.  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters, other than MTV, were significantly higher in non-luminal breast tumors than luminal tumors and in high-grade tumors than low-grade ones. Triple-negative tumors had the highest  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameter, but the difference was insignificant for MTV. The SUV max  had the strongest correlation with Ki-67 proliferative index. Tumors with aggressive histopathological features had higher  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameter values. This study suggests that  18 F-FDG PET/CT may provide prognostic information in patients with early-stage IDBC.",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34658227,NA,30,3,Mol Imaging Radionucl Ther

Clinical course and neuroradiological findings in a large cohort of paediatric patients with COQ4 deficiency were analysed. Functional studies in patient-derived cell lines were performed. We characterised 44 individuals from 36 families with COQ4 deficiency (16 newly described). A total of 23 different variants were identified, including four novel variants in  COQ4 . Correlation analyses of clinical and neuroimaging findings revealed three disease patterns: type 1: early-onset phenotype with neonatal brain anomalies and epileptic encephalopathy; type 2: intermediate phenotype with distinct stroke-like lesions; and type 3: moderate phenotype with non-specific brain pathology and a stable disease course. The functional relevance of  COQ4  variants was supported by in vitro studies using patient-derived fibroblast lines. Experiments revealed significantly decreased COQ4 protein levels, reduced levels of cellular CoQ 10  and elevated levels of the metabolic intermediate 6-demethoxyubiquinone. Our study describes the heterogeneous clinical presentation of COQ4 deficiency and identifies phenotypic subtypes. Cell-based studies support the pathogenic characteristics of  COQ4  variants.

Most affected patients have a history of breast cancer treated with radical mastectomy. Here, we report a case of STS with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) for a period of seven years. A 56-year-old woman presented with chronic lymphedema of the left arm. Nine years previously she had modified radical mastectomy for grade 2, invasive, ductal breast cancer. Upon physical examination, a tender, purplish lesion on the medial half of the affected arm was observed. The lesion spread rapidly with different-sized, scattered, purple-colored lesions in the affected area. A prompt skin biopsy was reported as STS. An immediate arm amputation was performed. However, a few months later she presented with new lesions on the anterior thorax and subsequent local recurrence around the scar. She received radiation-therapy. However, six months later the angiosarcoma had spread to the pelvic and upper limb area with scattered skin lesions. She had several problems during the chemotherapy and radiation-therapy, although she survived beyond 20 months. In conclusion, STS is a rare but aggressive and important complication of BCRL. Awareness of rapidly progressing skin lesions and detailed investigation, as well as prompt surgery is necessary for patients with BCRL in order to relatively increase the survival time.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34651118,NA,17,4,Eur J Breast Health

Therefore, it may have a role on micropapillary carcinomas (IMPC), which have characteristic morphological features. The aim was to investigate the expression levels of Galectin-3 within tumor and peritumoral CAFs in IMPC, and to compare with expression in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained preparations of resection materials examined between 2010-2016 were re-evaluated. Thirty-four IMPC cases and 34 IDC cases with similar molecular subtype distribution to IMPC were compared. Galectin-3 levels were evaluated with a calculated H-score in tumor and semi-quantitatively in CAFs. While tumoral Galectin-3 expression levels were higher in IMPCs compared to IDCs, there was no difference for Galectin-3 expression in CAFs between the two histologic types. However, there was no significant relationship between tumoral Galectin-3 expression and clinicopathological parameters in IMPCs. When the subjects were divided into two groups, depending on their Galectin-3 status regardless of histological types, the loss of Galectin-3 expression in tumor was found to be related to larger tumor size/advanced pT stage and a greater number of metastatic nodes. Additionally, expression of Galectin-3 in CAFs was found to be associated with distant metastasis. IMPC showed prominent Galectin-3 expression in tumor compared to IDC. However, independent from the histological type, whereas the loss of Galectin-3 expression in tumor showed an association with larger tumor size and higher number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes, the presence of Galectin-3 expression in CAFs showed an association with distant metastasis.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34651113,NA,17,4,Eur J Breast Health

A better understanding of risk factors for adverse outcomes may improve clinical management in these patients. We therefore studied baseline characteristics of HM patients developing COVID-19 and analyzed predictors of mortality. The survey was supported by the Scientific Working Group Infection in Hematology of the European Hematology Association (EHA). Eligible for the analysis were adult patients with HM and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 observed between March and December 2020. The study sample includes 3801 cases, represented by lymphoproliferative (mainly non-Hodgkin lymphoma n = 1084, myeloma n = 684 and chronic lymphoid leukemia n = 474) and myeloproliferative malignancies (mainly acute myeloid leukemia n = 497 and myelodysplastic syndromes n = 279). Severe/critical COVID-19 was observed in 63.8% of patients (n = 2425). Overall, 2778 (73.1%) of the patients were hospitalized, 689 (18.1%) of whom were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Overall, 1185 patients (31.2%) died. The primary cause of death was COVID-19 in 688 patients (58.1%), HM in 173 patients (14.6%), and a combination of both COVID-19 and progressing HM in 155 patients (13.1%). Highest mortality was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (199/497, 40%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (118/279, 42.3%).

Prior to 6-OHDA treatment, SH-SY5Y cells had been pre-treated with bromelain (25 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL, 75 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL). After 1 day, cell viability was determined with the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Oxidative stress was assessed with total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), glutathione reductase (GR) and malondialdehyde (MDA) analyses. The effect of the bromelain in SH-SY5Ycells was also examined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. We found that 6-OHDA increased LDH leakage, and cellular apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. 6-OHDA aggravated oxidative stress by increasing TOS, MDA and GR and eventually promoted apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, while pretreatment with bromelain attenuated these toxic effects of 6-OHDA.

Screening of these compounds in various colon, breast, and pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed anti-cancer activity for all compounds, with curcumin being the most effective among these in all cell lines. Although some of the natural products were able to induce MET in some cancer cell lines, the MET induction was not related to increased synergy with either 5-FU, irinotecan, gemcitabine, or gefitinib. When synergy was observed, for example with curcumin and irinotecan, this was unrelated to MET induction, as assessed by changes in E-cadherin and vimentin expression.

While basolateral staining was observed in papillary tumors, membrane staining was observed in other stained cases. It was hypothesized that the use of TRPM4 along with morphological findings, cytokeratin 7 and other markers may be useful for the differentiation of eosinophilic kidney tumors.",eng,NA,NA,NA,ppublish,34631055,NA,15,5,Mol Clin Oncol

Although they have been extensively studied in the stomach and other digestive system organs, limited data regarding nonampullary small bowel poorly cohesive carcinomas (SB-PCCs) are hitherto available. The aims of our study were to analyze the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypical features of SB-PCCs (PCC pattern accounting for >50% of the neoplasm) and to compare them with small bowel adenocarcinomas (SBAs), not otherwise specified (SBAs-NOS) and with cancers with a histologically distinct PCC component accounting for 10% to 50% of the neoplasm (mixed-poorly-cohesive-glandular-SBAs). Fifteen SB-PCCs were identified and compared with 95 SBAs-NOS and 27 mixed-poorly-cohesive-glandular-SBAs. Most SB-PCCs (67%) were composed of <10% of signet-ring cells, and all but 1 SB-PCCs exhibited loss of membranous expression of E-cadherin. Compared with SBAs-NOS, SB-PCCs showed a significantly younger patient age at diagnosis, and a stronger association with Crohn disease, and both SB-PCCs and mixed-poorly-cohesive-glandular-SBAs featured a higher rate of lymphovascular and perineural invasion and a lower percentage of mismatch repair-deficient cases. Importantly, the cancer-specific survival of SB-PCC (hazard ratio: 3.81; 95% confidence interval: 1.90-7.64; P<0.001) and mixed-poorly-cohesive-glandular-SBA (4.12; 2.20-7.71; P<0.001) patients was significantly worse compared with SBAs-NOS cases. This study provides objective evidence to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 introduction of SB-PCC as a distinctive subtype of nonampullary SBA, by virtue of its unique clinical and histologic features, and suggests that both SB-PCCs and mixed-poorly-cohesive-glandular-SBAs should be separated from SBAs-NOS.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34628432,NA,NA,NA,Am J Surg Pathol

The pregnancy was terminated. Case 2 had multiple intrathoracic masses, thoracic hypoplasia, pleural effusion, and fetal death. Both were diagnosed as fibrosarcoma at fetopsy.  Discussion:  Although congenital CF tends to be locally aggressive with a low metastatic rate, it tends to grow rapidly and the tumor location can affect fetal survival. In Case 1, the tumor demonstrated locally aggressive behavior whereas multiple distant metastases such as lung, liver, adrenals, and left eye were detected in Case 2.

We aimed to examine the expression of the markers ımmune receptor translocation -associated protein 1 (IRTA1), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1) and stathmin1 in SBCL cases involving different sites which may have plasma cell differentiation. We studied 154 involved tissue samples, from 116 patients and evaluated the staining distribution of the markers. The expressions were evaluated on 21 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ lymphoma (CLL/SLL), 7 follicular lymphoma (FL), 14 nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), 17 extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (ENMZL), 55 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 22 marginal zone lymphoma -not otherwise specified (MZL-NOS) and 18 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WS) cases by immunohistochemistry. The results confirmed that LEF1 was the most sensitive and specific markers for CLL/SLL and Stathmin for FL (p <0.001). MNDA and IRTA1 were useful markers to distinguish marginal zone lymphomas. Our results suggest LEF 1 for CLL/SLL and Stathmin for FL are reliable markers.

Because of its importance as a model organism for studies on developmental biology, Xenopus laevis has been chosen as the study animal in in vitro teratogenesis studies. FETAX test uses early-stage embryos of X. laevis to measure the potential of substances to cause mortality, malformation, and growth inhibition in developing embryos. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of high molecular weight polyvinyl chloride (HMW-PVC) on parental X. laevis frogs and their embryos using the FETAX test. To this purpose, a HMW-PVC dose of 1% of body weight/twice each week was provided to frogs by oral gavage throughout 6 weeks. After the procedure, oocytes and sperms of HMW-PVC-exposed frogs were fertilized and FETAX was applied to selected embryos. After the completion of a 96-h incubation period, tadpoles were examined, their live/dead status were determined, their lengths were measured, and their anomalies were photographed. Besides, excised organs of the parental frogs were referred to histopathology examination. On the other hand, the mRNA expression levels of Hsp70, Myf5, Bmp4, Pax6, and Esr1 genes were determined by applying real-time quantitative PCR method to cDNA which was synthesized from the total RNA of embryos. The results showed that treatment with HMW-PVC dose of 1% of body weight/twice each week caused malformations and decreased viability. Hsp70 and Pax6 gene expression levels significantly decreased in all assay groups, as compared with controls. Lung and intestine tissues showed normal appearance in histopatological examination. Further research is required to explain the whole effects of HMW-PVC exposure on X. laevis embryos.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34617235,NA,NA,NA,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int

This study aimed to investigate the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation on GDUT levels, inflammatory and antioxidant parameters, renal damage, and intestinal barrier function in adenine-induced CKD rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control group (CTL, n = 12) fed with standard diet; and CKD group (n = 16) given adenine (200 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 3-weeks to induce CKD. At the 4th week, CKD rats were subdivided into prebiotic supplementation (5g/kg/day) for four consecutive weeks (CKD-Pre, n = 8). Also, the control group was subdivided into two subgroups; prebiotic supplemented (CTL-Pre, n = 6) and non-supplemented group (CTL, n = 6). Results showed that prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation did not significantly reduce serum indoxyl sulfate (IS) but did significantly reduce serum p-Cresyl sulfate (PCS) (p = 0.002) in CKD rats. Prebiotic supplementation also reduced serum urea (p = 0.008) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels (p = 0.001), ameliorated renal injury, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (p = 0.002) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p = 0.001) in renal tissues of CKD rats. No significant changes were observed in colonic epithelial tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin in the CKD-Pre group.

One hundred eighty 1-day-old male chickens were randomly assigned to three research groups: control (standard temperature throughout the experiment), cyclic HS (32 ºC between 0800 and 2000 h from day 21 until the end of the experiment), and chronic HS (32 ºC from day 21 onwards). Cyclic and chronic HS groups showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in body weight gain and feed intake and poor feed conversion ratio in grower, finisher, and overall period. Serum biochemical profile was not different among the groups except globulin and P which were significantly higher (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively), in cyclic and chronic HS groups. Overall, WS incidence was numerically higher in control birds followed by chronic HS and cyclic HS birds, respectively. The chronic HS group had a lower incidence of mild (score 1) and a higher incidence of severe (score 2) WS lesions compared to control and cyclic HS groups. Histopathological analysis revealed that broilers subjected to chronic HS showed increased severity of myodegenerative changes, perivenular CD3 + cell infiltration, and lipidosis compared to control group. However, control and cyclic HS groups were not different in terms of histopathological lesions. In conclusion, this study confirms that cyclic or chronic HS may adversely affect the growth performance and that chronic HS may increase the severity of WS in broiler chickens.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34613480,NA,53,5,Trop Anim Health Prod

Therefore, we evaluated the cyst location's relationship with malignancy, and the possibility of using cyst size and location to distinguish between non-main duct (non-MD)-IPMNs, mucinous cystic neoplasia (MCN), and cystic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 122 patients with a definite cyto-histological diagnosis of non-MDIPMNs, LR-MCNs, and cystic PDACs via endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration between October 2011 and October 2020. We grouped the cyst locations as head, uncinate, neck (HUN), and corpus or tail (CT). On histology, low-grade dysplasia and intermediategrade dysplasia were considered low risk (LR), whereas high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma were considered high risk (HR). Of the 122 patients (61 (50%) women, median age 61.5 years (range 19-85), there were 34 (27.9%) LR-non-MD-IPMNs, 33 (27%) HR-non-MD-IPMNs, 19 (15.6%) LR-MCNs, and 36 (29.5%) cystic PDACs.

In this study, the impact of intensity of TILs and expressions of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in a group of breast carcinomas with regards to the prognosis and conventional pathologic parameters was scrutinized. For this purpose, 238 patients with IBCs containing different proportions of TILs were included in the study. IBCs with higher proportion of TILs were usually grade III carcinomas and correlated with poor prognostic features like receptor negativity, nonluminal intrinsic subtype (P<0.001). Similarly, PD-1 and LAG-3 positivity in immune cells (IC) were more likely to be positive in grade III IBC cases (P=0.004). In addition, PD-1 positivity in IC was more frequent in estrogen receptor-negative tumors (P=0.011) whereas LAG-3 positivity increased in large sized, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor-negative tumors (P=0.050, 0.023, 0.04, respectively). CTLA-4 positivity in IC was more frequent in large-sized tumors (P=0.040). These 3 markers were also significantly associated with one another and also with the amount of TILs. In survival analysis, cases with prominent-TILs especially displaying CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG-3 positivity appeared to have longer disease-free and overall survival (CTLA-4: P=0.027, P=0.024; PD-1: P=0.030, P=0.026; LAG-3: P=0.006, P=0.012, respectively). We conclude that the high proportion of TILs and as well as high expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG-3 in TILs have positively contributed to the outcome despite their correlation with poor conventional pathologic features. We suggest that these 3 immune markers can be used for the determination of proper treatment as well as prediction of prognosis in IBCs with TILs.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34608875,NA,NA,NA,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol

In rats, the dorsal multi-territory perforator flap was elevated, and the agents were injected. In postoperative 1 wk, flap viability and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were evaluated. Also, blood flow, microvascular density, and inflammation degree of both choke zones were assessed. The mean flap survival area and vascular endothelial growth factor level were significantly higher in group E than in group B and S (P < 0.001). Similarly, blood flow (first choke zone, P < 0.012, and second choke zone, P < 0.001) and microvascular density (first choke zone and second choke zone, P < 0.001) were found to be higher in Group E compared to Group B and S in the evaluation performed from both choke zones. Also, significant inflammation was detected in the ethanol group. The positive effects of BTX-A on flap viability were achieved with a low concentration of ethanol. The fact that a low concentration of ethanol increases blood flow, angiogenesis, and flap viability more than BTX-A in the first postoperative week indicates that it can be an alternative agent for perioperative use.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34607144,NA,269,NA,J Surg Res

To investigate the biochemical and histopathological effects of ATP, benidipine and ATP in combination with benidipine on bevacizumab-induced kidney damage in rats. Rats were divided into 5 treatment groups: bevacizumab (BVZ) alone, ATP + bevacizumab (ABVZ), benidipine + bevacizumab (BBVZ), ATP + benidipine + bevacizumab (ABBVZ), and healthy controls (HC). Adenosine triphosphate (25 mg/kg), benidipine (4 mg/kg orally), ATP (25 mg/kg) + benidipine (4 mg/kg), or saline were administered to albino Wistar rats. One hour after treatment, bevacizumab was injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg to induce kidney damage. Two doses of bevacizumab were delivered 15 days apart. Adenosine triphosphate + benidipine were administered once a day for 1 month. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant status (TOS), creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels of the BVZ, BBVZ, ABVZ, ABBVZ, and HC groups were ranked from highest to lowest. Conversely, total glutathione (tGSH) and total antioxidant status (TAS) kidney tissue values were ranked from lowest to highest, respectively. Hemorrhage, tubular necrosis and grade 3 focal tubular atrophy were observed in the BVZ group. Atrophy and grade 2 necrosis were observed in the BBVZ group and atrophy and grade 1 necrosis were observed in the ABVZ group. Only grade 1 atrophy was observed in the ABBVZ group. Adenosine triphosphate reduced bevacizumab-induced renal toxicity significantly more effectively than benidipine. However, the combination of ATP + benidipine further reduced bevacizumab-induced renal toxicity relative to benidipine or ATP alone.

34581245,2021,9,NA,NA,"The effect of carbamazepine, which increases oestrogen destruction, on the endometriotic implants; an experimental rat model.",NA,"We planned this experimental study to investigate the effect of carbamazepine (CMZ) on the endometriotic implants. Rats were randomised into four groups after endometriosis surgery. Drinking water was given to the sham group, 0.2 mg/kg oestradiol valerate (EV) to the EV group, 100 mg/kg/day CMZ to the CMZ group, and 0.2 mg/kg EV and 100 mg/kg/day CMZ to the EV-CMZ group. The endometrium of the rats using CMZ stained more intensely with cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. No endometrial hyperplasia was found in these rats. Endometriotic implants weight was found to be higher in these rats. There was no difference between the groups in terms of staining of the endometriotic implants with CYP3A4 enzyme. Endometriotic implants were less stained with the CYP3A4 enzyme than the endometrium. According to our results, CMZ does not increase the destruction of oestrogen in the endometriotic implants, unlike the endometrium. It may even cause the lesion to enlarge.Impact statement What is already known on this subject?  Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent, progressive disease. Carbamazepine (CMZ) is known to increase oestrogen degradation by activating the cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. CMZ can be used in the treatment of endometriosis because it increases oestrogen breakdown in tissues. What do the results of this study add?  CMZ can protect the endometrium against hyperplasia by increasing the amount of CYP3A4 enzyme in the endometrium. This effect could not be demonstrated in the endometriotic implants. The presence of CYP3A4 enzyme less in the endometriotic implants than in the endometrium may explain this situation. In addition, the fact that CMZ does not increase the enzyme in the endometriotic implants may contribute to this situation. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?  CMZ may not be a suitable alternative in the treatment of endometriosis. However, it may protect against endometrial hyperplasia. Clinical studies are needed for this effect.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34581245,NA,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

The effect of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT-1), the main carrier protein responsible for glucose transport, was investigated in breast cancer patients. 170 patients operated for breast carcinoma were included in this study. We analysed the prognostic significance of GLUT-1 immune-expression in 149 patients without neoadjuvant therapy, and in 21 patients with neoadjuvant therapy. GLUT-1 expression was correlated with poor prognostic factors such as estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negativity, high Ki-67 proliferation index, and high histological and nuclear grade (p < 0.001). GLUT-1 was expressed at a statistically higher rate in invasive ductal carcinomas, compared to invasive lobular carcinomas (p < 0.001), and was expressed at a higher rate in luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and triple-negative molecular subtypes compared to luminal A subtype tumors (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between GLUT-1 expression and presence of neoadjuvant therapy. Univariate survival analysis showed high GLUT1 expression was associated with low disease-free survival. GLUT-1 expression was found to be associated with poor pathological prognostic factors in breast carcinoma patients.

This series aimed to identify the biochemical and histopathological correlates of MIBI scan findings in patients with parathyroid adenoma. A total of 378 patients with histologically and biochemically proven parathyroid adenoma were included. The results of MIBI scan, histopathological (gland volume and weight, oxyphil cell ratio), biochemical (blood and 24 h urine calcium, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, parathormone, alkaline phosphate, and vitamin D3) variables were recorded. A positive uptake on the MIBI scan referred to a localized adenoma. Among histological variables, a cutoff of 30% was applied to define parathyroid adenomas with low (≤ 30%) and high (> 30%) oxyphil cell content. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship among variables. MIBI scan localized the adenoma in 306 patients. Parathyroid gland volume and weight, and oxyphil ratio were significantly higher in the MIBI scan-positive group. Among the biochemical variables, only PTH was found to be significantly increased in the MIBI scan-positive group. Binary logistic regression models identified statistically significant cutoffs for the gland volume (1700 mm 3 ), gland weight (1.3 g) and PTH levels (170 pg/mL) that can be used to predict the MIBI scan positivity.

To describe the evolution of sTIL and some peripheral inflammation markers (Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio) after NACT in IBC, we retrospectively collected clinicopathological variables for 125 stage III IBC patients. sTILs were scored by three different researchers on an H&E slide of the mastectomy specimen. A cohort of subtype-matched non-IBC breast cancer patients (nIBC) treated with NACT was included for comparison. There was no significant difference in the pre- and posttreatment sTIL scores between IBC and nIBC and in both groups the number of sTIL was significantly lower after NACT.

Therefore, tailored ex vivo models that faithfully recapitulate in vivo tumour biology are urgently needed. These may especially benefit the management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where therapy failure has been ascribed to its high cancer stem cell (CSC) content and high density of stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). To date, these features are only partially reproduced ex vivo using organoid and sphere cultures. We have now developed a more comprehensive and highly tuneable ex vivo model of PDAC based on the 3D co-assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PAs) with custom ECM components (PA-ECM). These cultures maintain patient-specific transcriptional profiles and exhibit CSC functionality, including strong in vivo tumourigenicity. User-defined modification of the system enables control over niche-dependent phenotypes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and matrix deposition. Indeed, proteomic analysis of these cultures reveals improved matrisome recapitulation compared to organoids. Most importantly, patient-specific in vivo drug responses are better reproduced in self-assembled cultures than in other models.

We identified 84 patients with grade II-IV glioma with IDH, ATRX, 1p / 19q and TERT status. All tumor samples were subjected to molecular genetic screening (Sanger sequencing for IDH and TERT mutations, fluorescence in situ hybridization for 1p/19q status) after histological diagnosis (immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132H, ATRX, and p53) for a more precise molecular diagnosis. The confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% confidence level, and differences at p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Primary glioblastomas had the highest frequency of TERT promoter mutations (25 of 28, 89.2%, p=0.006) followed by oligodendrogliomas (29 of 35, 82.8%, p < 0.001) while astrocytomas showed the lowest frequency (3 of 15, 20%, p=0.107), and the positivity significantly differed among these three groups (p < 0.001).

34552052,2020,9,NA,NA,Terminal differentiation of human granulosa cells as luteinization is reversed by activin-A through silencing of Jnk pathway.,NA,"Molecular mechanisms underlying luteinization (terminal differentiation of granulosa and theca cells after ovulation) and luteolysis (demise of corpus luteum) are poorly understood in human ovary. Here we report that activin-A, after binding to its cognate receptors induces a functional luteolytic state and reverses luteinization phenotype by downregulating the expression of the steroidogenic enzymes, LH receptor and VEGF and reducing estradiol (E 2 ) progesterone (P 4 ) production and upregulating FSH receptor and cyclin D1 expression in human primary luteinized granulosa cells. Further, this action of activin-A involves downregulation of JNK signaling pathway and is opposite to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which acts as a luteotropic hormone and improves luteal function through the activation of JNK pathway in the same cell type. Reversal of luteinization phenotype in luteal granulosa cells by activin-A potentially makes this hormone an attractive candidate for use under certain clinical situations, where induction of luteolysis and rapid reduction of endogenous sex steroid levels are beneficial such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), in which the ovaries hyper-respond to gonadotropin stimulation by producing too many growing follicles along with development of ascites, pleural effusion, and hemo-concentrations as a result of increased vascular permeability and leakage of intravascular volume into third spaces. Our work unveils a previously undefined role for activin-A and JNK signaling pathway in human corpus luteum biology, that might have a direct clinical impact in assisted reproductive technologies.",eng,NA,NA,NA,epublish,34552052,NA,6,1,Cell Death Discov

Recent studies identified four distinct medulloblastoma subgroups with different molecular alterations and pathways, and natural courses and outcomes. To evaluate the results of surgical and medical treatments of patients with medulloblastoma and compare them among the medulloblastoma subgroups. The clinical and radiological features, medical and surgical management and treatment outcomes and their correlation with molecular subgroups of 58 patients treated for medulloblastoma in the last 20 years were evaluated. Fifty-eight patients, of whom 35 were male and 23 were female, were evaluated. The median age was 6 years (range, 1-19 years). The most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting (60%). Forty-three percent of the patients had headache and 40% had ataxia. Previous pathology reports revealed that 43 (74%), eight (14%), five (8%), and two (3%) had classic, desmoplastic, desmoplastic/nodular, and anaplastic morphologies, respectively. After the subgroup analyses, five patients (12%) were attributed to the wingless subgroup (WNT) group; 14 (32.5%), to the sonic hedgehog subgroup (SHH) group; and 24 (56%), to the non-WNT non-SHH group. On the basis of immunohistochemical analysis results, 15 patients could not be attributed to any subgroups.

Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be a predictor of disease severity and progression to fatty liver disease. Therefore, research addressing gut-based therapies has become popular. To investigate the effect of lactulose and polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350) in mice with induced obesity and NAFLD at a non-diarrheal dose. Thirty-six C57BL/6J male mice were divided into 6 groups. The first 2 groups (n = 6 each) were used as an induced obesity model (group A) and NAFLD model (group B) for 8 weeks. The remaining 24 animals were categorized into control diet group, high-fat diet (HFD) group, HFD + lactulose group, and HFD + PEG 3350 group. Serum and liver tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and histopathological analyses, respectively. The HFD + lactulose treatment group displayed a significant decrease in liver weight (1.3 (1.3-1.4) kg compared to 1.8 (1.6-1.9) kg) and NAFLD activity score (NAS) (1.5 (1.0-3.0) compared to 5.0 (4.0-5.0), respectively; p = 0.0043, p = 0.0021) when compared with the HFD group.

Another purpose is to compare the IVF outcomes of described RIF patients with patients undergoing the first cycle of IVF. In this retrospective cohort study, CE was diagnosed with CD-138 immunohistochemical staining. Among RIF patients, two groups were formed as group 1, including patients diagnosed with CE and treated by antibiotics (n = 129), and group 2, including patients without CE (n = 103). Patients with the first IVF cycle having similar infertility etiologies with RIF patients were reviewed as group 3 (n = 932). CE was diagnosed in 55.6% of RIF patients. The number of oocytes retrieved was not different between groups. Implantation rates (IR) were similar after antibiotic treatment in RIF patients with or without CE. However, Group 3 had a higher IR (41.1%) than group 1 and 2 (23.1% and 30.1%, respectively) (p < 0.001). Clinical pregnancy (CPR) and live birth rates (LBR) were comparable between RIF groups.

IGM is an uncommon, non-malignant, chronic inflammatory disease of the mammary gland with an unknown etiology. The symptoms, clinical presentation, and radiologic findings of IGM may resemble carcinomas. To our knowledge, this study comprises the largest series of IGM, especially with a 5-year follow-up, yet reported in the English literature. The present study reported our single-center clinical experience at a tertiary university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, and introduced a diagnostic algorithm using our treatment protocol based on a 5-year follow-up of 152 women with biopsy-proven IGM. Our database of 10 years' experience containing over 700 patients with IGM was evaluated. However, to assess recurrence and resistance to treatment, only the 152 patients with a long follow-up period of 5 years were included in the study group. The analysis included 152 women with biopsy-proven IGM who were treated between January 2009 and March 2014. The clinical data of the presentation, histopathology, and treatment modalities were analyzed by reviewing the medical records. Of the 152 patients diagnosed with granulomatous mastitis, 32 (21%) recovered by expectant management, while 14 (9%) responded to antibiotics, 65 (43%) received corticosteroids, 20 (13%) had antituberculosis medication, 16 (11%) underwent excision, and 5 (3%) responded to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Fifty-one patients (33%) had recurrence; of these, 30 achieved a cure with second-line treatment, 16 underwent excision, and 5 achieved a cure with observation. IGM is a rare benign breast disorder, and clinicians need a high index of suspicion to diagnose it, as IGM can be mistaken for breast cancer. Unlike periductal mastitis, IGM does not evolve secondary to nicotine addiction and is typically seen in women of childbearing age with a recent history of pregnancy and lactation. The diagnosis can be challenging, and an evaluation with a multidisciplinary team is necessary. There is no consensus concerning the definitive treatment approach. We suggested a diagnostic algorithm in the present study, using our treatment protocol based on the 5 years' follow-up of 152 women.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34549317,NA,NA,NA,Surg Today

Although histopathologic examination is gold standard, avoiding unnecessary endoscopy is crucial. Therefore, from the perspective of the clinicians and patients' families, the diagnosis of celiac disease remains challenging. With these in mind, a joint working group (Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease Joint Working Group) was gathered, with the aim of reporting institutional data, as well as the current recommendations of international organizations, in order to provide a framework for clinicians. Several controversial issues were discussed: For CD screening in children with T1D, regardless of age, it is recommended to measure tTG-IgA (tissue transglutaminase-Immunoglobulin A) and/or endomysial (EMA-IgA) antibody due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, the decision-making process based on tTG-IgA titer in children with T1D is still debated, since tTG-IgA titers may fluctuate in children with T1D. Moreover, seronegativity may occur spontaneously. The authors' own data showed that most of the cases who have biopsy-proven CD had tTG-IgA levels 7-10 times above the upper limit. The decision of endoscopy based solely on tTG-IgA levels should be avoided, except in cases where tTG-IgA levels are 7 times and above the upper limit. A closer collaboration should be built between divisions of pediatric endocrinology and gastroenterology in terms of screening, diagnosis and follow-up of children with T1D and suspicious CD.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34538045,NA,NA,NA,J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol

In this work, we explore the anatomical basis of a proposed approach to the regional anesthesia of the shoulder through a single injection under the subscapularis muscle. Bilateral experimental injections in shoulders from body donors (Radiolar ® and Methylene-Blue) under the subscapular muscle (n = 11) and cadaveric systematic dissections of other 35 shoulders from body donors were performed. Injectate spread was then qualitatively assessed. Long axis of permeable foramina in the anterior aspect of the shoulder joint capsule was measured in centimeters using a digital caliper. More than 40% of specimens had at least one permeable space (Weitbrech and/or Rouvière foramina) communicating the subscapular bursa and the articular space. We further demonstrate that an ultrasonography-guided injection under the subscapularis muscle allows the spread of the injectate through the anterior, inferior and posterodorsal walls of the articular capsule, the subacromial bursa, and the bicipital groove, as well as into the articular space for some injections. The odds of accidental intraarticular injection decrease when injecting with low volumes. This anatomical study provides a detailed description of foramina between glenohumeral ligaments. Furthermore, the data shown in this work supports, as a proof of concept, a safe alternative for rapid and specific blockade of terminal sensory branches innervating the shoulder joint capsule.",eng,NA,NA,NA,aheadofprint,34536540,NA,239,NA,Ann Anat
