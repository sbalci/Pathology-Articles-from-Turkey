Tumors located exclusively in the deep lobe are not common and 20% of parotid gland tumors originate from deep lobe under the branches of the facial nerve. Accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) procedure in salivary gland tumors have been studied extensively, however there isn't any data regarding usefulness of FNAB in tumors located exclusively in deep lobe of parotid gland. In this study we aimed to assess the use of FNAB in deep lobe parotid tumors.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with deep lobe parotid tumors who underwent surgery in our clinic between January 2013-December 2018. Characteristics of patients were recorded. Preoperative FNAB results and postoperative final histopathologic diagnosis were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 24.0 was used for statistical analysis.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The number of patients that met the inclusion criteria was 51. The mean age of patients were 49.2(14-86). In 40 (78.4) of the patients, tumor was reported as benign and in 11 (21.6) patients FNAB diagnosis was suspicious for malignancy, malignant or non-diagnostic. In final histopathologic diagnosis, 42 of the tumors were benign and 9 were malignant. The most common benign tumor type was pleomorphic adenoma which constitutes 27 of the cases (52.9%). Regarding detection of malignant disease, the sensitivity of FNAB was 90.4%, specificity was 77.7%, positive predictive value was 95%, negative predictive value was 63.6%. There was a substantial agreement between FNAB and final histopathologic diagnosis(kappa = 0,628).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":FNAB is a safe and reliable tool to evaluate deep lobe parotid tumors. It is an important part of preoperative surgical planning and can help the surgeon in patient counseling. FNAB with ultrasound guidance is recommended for deep lobe tumors.",eng,Am J Otolaryngol,8000029,0196-0709,ppublish,33045535,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102590,42,1,Am J Otolaryngol

Here we report that activin-A, after binding to its cognate receptors induces a functional luteolytic state and reverses luteinization phenotype by downregulating the expression of the steroidogenic enzymes, LH receptor and VEGF and reducing estradiol (E2) progesterone (P4) production and upregulating FSH receptor and cyclin D1 expression in human primary luteinized granulosa cells. Further, this action of activin-A involves downregulation of JNK signaling pathway and is opposite to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which acts as a luteotropic hormone and improves luteal function through the activation of JNK pathway in the same cell type. Reversal of luteinization phenotype in luteal granulosa cells by activin-A potentially makes this hormone an attractive candidate for use under certain clinical situations, where induction of luteolysis and rapid reduction of endogenous sex steroid levels are beneficial such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), in which the ovaries hyper-respond to gonadotropin stimulation by producing too many growing follicles along with development of ascites, pleural effusion, and hemo-concentrations as a result of increased vascular permeability and leakage of intravascular volume into third spaces.

However, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems exist, and consensus is lacking as to which system represents best practice. An international consensus meeting on TRS took place in November 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, we provide an overview of the outcomes and consensus statements that originated from this meeting. Consensus (≥80% agreement) was reached on a total of seven statements: (1) TRS is important because it provides information about the effect of neoadjuvant treatment that is not provided by other histopathology-based descriptors. (2) TRS for resected PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy should assess residual (viable) tumor burden instead of tumor regression. (3) The CAP scoring system is considered the most adequate scoring system to date because it is based on the presence and amount of residual cancer cells instead of tumor regression. (4) The defining criteria of the categories in the CAP scoring system should be improved by replacing subjective terms including &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot; with objective criteria to evaluate the extent of viable tumor. (5) The improved, consensus-based system should be validated retrospectively and prospectively. (6) Prospective studies should determine the extent of tissue sampling that is required to ensure adequate assessment of the residual cancer burden, taking into account the heterogeneity of tumor response.

The protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase-1 (NQO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were measured with ELISA; the immunopositivity of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and caspase 3 were determined with immunohistochemistry; the mRNA transcript levels of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase 3, protein kinase B1/2 (Akt-1/2), and forkhead box transcription factor, class O1 (FOXO1) were determined with RT-PCR. The reduction of Nrf2 levels and HO-1 and NQO1 activities in the sciatic nerve tissue, the increase in the levels of 8-OHdG, and the increase in the levels of GFAP and NF-κB caused by vincristine was observed to cause oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, neuronal cell damage, and inflammation, respectively. Additionally, vincristine was determined to cause ER stress and apoptosis by increasing PERK, IRE1, ATF-6, and GRP78 and caspase 3 and Bax expressions and by decreasing Bcl-2 expressions. Vincristine causing Akt inhibition also shows that it prevents neuronal survival.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Median duration of disease onset after the ABS was 16 (8-38) months. After the diagnosis of GM was obtained, all patients received steroid treatment. Median steroid treatment duration was 10 (8-20) weeks. Methotrexate was administered in two patients due to persistent breast mass and steroid side effect. Surgical excision was performed in three patients with wide excision. No patient needed further surgery such as mastectomy. Median follow-up period was 37.5 (18-70) months.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This is the first study to declare GM in patients who underwent ABS. Atypical clinical presentation such as breast abscess, mass or fistula after ABS should alert the surgeon about GM. Unlike other mastitis, the primary treatment of this rare disease is steroid and immunosuppressive treatment. Insufficient knowledge about GM can lead to unnecessary surgeries or breast loss.

To determine why individuals with MRS specifically lack pancreatic endocrine cells, we micro-CT imaged a 12-week-old foetus homozygous for the nonsense mutation RFX6 c.1129C&gt;T, which revealed loss of the pancreas body and tail. From this foetus, we derived iPSCs and show that differentiation of these cells in vitro proceeds normally until generation of pancreatic endoderm, which is significantly reduced. We additionally generated an RFX6HA reporter allele by gene targeting in wild-type H9 cells to precisely define RFX6 expression and in parallel performed in situ hybridisation for RFX6 in the dorsal pancreatic bud of a Carnegie stage 14 human embryo. Both in vitro and in vivo, we find that RFX6 specifically labels a subset of PDX1-expressing pancreatic endoderm. In summary, RFX6 is essential for efficient differentiation of pancreatic endoderm, and its absence in individuals with MRS specifically impairs formation of endocrine cells of the pancreas head and tail.",eng,Development,8701744,0950-1991,epublish,33033118,10.1242/dev.194878,147,21,Development

An experimental study.,10.1080/2000656X.2020.1828901,"Recently, most of the immediate breast reconstructions following mastectomy are being carried out with the use of silicone implants. In these patients, methylene blue is being used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. This experimental study was performed to determine the effect of methylene blue on capsular contracture around breast implants. Thirty-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Custom made silicone blocks were placed on the back of animals. In group 1, the incision was closed without performing any additional procedure. In group 2 (control), 0.1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was instilled into the pocket. Group 3 and 4 (study groups) received 0.1 and 0.2 mL of 1% methylene blue, respectively. On postoperative day 60, implants and capsular tissue were extracted. Capsule formation was evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. The histological evaluation included capsule thickness, inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis gradients. Regarding capsule thickness, there were statistically significant differences between groups 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, and 2-4. Although there were more moderate and severe inflammation gradients in groups III and IV, there was no significant difference regarding inflammation severity between control and study groups. In respect of vascular proliferation, there was a statistically significant difference between control and study groups. Similarly, fibrosis gradients were higher in both groups 3 and 4. The study showed that the injection of methylene blue around silicone implants enhanced the formation of capsular contracture. In this case, the degree of contracture was independent of the dose given.

We aimed to assess the association of tumour markers with histopathological structure of ovarian endometriomas to assess their roles in clinical management. Data from 86 women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma were evaluated. The possible risk factors for inadvertently removed normal ovarian parenchyma (IRNOP) during laparoscopic cystectomy and the relationship between tumour markers and histopathologic parameters of ovarian endometrioma were assessed. Age and the depth of penetration of endometrial tissue into the cyst wall showed a significant positive correlation with thickness of IRNOP. There was a significant negative correlation between IRNOP and the thickness of fibrosis on cyst wall. Thickness of fibrosis and the depth of penetration represented significant positive correlations with tumour markers (CA 125, CA 15-3, and CA 19-9), respectively. This is the first study that reveals the association between tumour markers and the histopathologic features of ovarian endometrioma. The outcome of the present study indicated that lower levels of tumour markers may permit a conservative management, rising levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and high levels may help in counselling postoperative outcomes. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Endometriosis is defined as a benign gynaecologic disease, and the vast majority of women who suffer from endometriosis are of reproductive age. Ovarian endometriotic cysts are found in one-fifth to one-half of patients with endometriosis. Laparoscopic cystectomy is accepted as the gold standard for the surgical management of ovarian endometriotic cysts because of the procedure's several clinical advantages, such as lower recurrence and higher pregnancy rates. However, studies have indicated that laparoscopic excision of an ovarian endometrioma capsule could be associated with a reduction in both the ovarian volume and the follicle count. What do the results of this study add? Our retrospective data indicate that tumour markers may have role in planning the management of ovarian endometriomas. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Low tumour markers levels may permit a conservative management, elevating levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and finally high levels may help in counselling the patient about her possible postoperative outcomes.",eng,J Obstet Gynaecol,8309140,0144-3615,aheadofprint,33054460,10.1080/01443615.2020.1791060,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":During the study period, 89 children met the inclusion criteria. Patients were followed for a median of 8.0 years. A total of 39 (44%) patients were diagnosed with EGID after transplantation. Of these, 29 (33%) had eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and 10 (11%) had eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis. In comparison with the non-EGID group, patients with EGID were younger at transplant (P ≤ 0.0001), transplanted more frequently due to biliary atresia (P ≤ 0.0001), and had higher rates of pretransplant allergy (P = 0.019). In the posttransplant period, they had higher rates of mammalian Target of Rapamycin inhibitor use (P = 0.006), Epstein-Barr virus viremia (P = 0.03), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (P = 0.005), and allergen sensitization (P ≤ 0.0001). In regression analysis, young age at transplant, age at diagnosis, pretransplant atopic dermatitis, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease were associated with an increased risk of EGID or EoE. Laboratory abnormalities such as anemia (P = 0.007), thrombocytosis (P = 0.012), and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.031) were more commonly observed in the eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis group than in the EoE group.

Plasma samples were collected on the same day of diagnosis and before any immunosuppressive treatment was initiated. At the time of diagnosis and sample collection, none of the patients had renal involvement. We used Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) to investigate the alterations in plasma metabolomic profiles. Three separate pools were created: healthy controls (group C), active IgAV patients who did not develop renal involvement (group H), and patients who developed IgAVN at follow up (group N).

Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Retrospective database research was conducted. Sixty nine meningioma and 15 schwannoma having DSC-PI between January 2016 and February 2020 were included. Time to signal intensity curves (TSIC) were analyzed and grouped as T1-dominant leakage, T2*-dominant leakage and return to baseline. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative mean transit time (rMTT), percentage signal recovery 1 (PSR 1) and PSR 2 values were calculated. The differences between the groups were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were operated.

The role of oophorectomy is yet to be established. We aimed to examine the effect of preserving the ovaries on the pattern of recurrences in patients with stage I disease. Thirty-four patients with stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma were retrospectively analysed. Based on ovarian preservation the whole cohort was divided into two groups. Recurrence (liver, lung, groin and bone) was detected in 4 (11.8%) cases. No significant differences in overall survival or disease-free survival (DFS) were observed between the ovarian preservation and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) groups. Subset analysis revealed no significant difference in DFS between the ovarian preservation and BSO groups in the premenopausal arm. And also, the performance of pelvic (n = 2) or para-aortic lymphadenectomy (n = 6) or adjuvant hormonal therapy did not alter DFS significantly. The 5-year DFS rate for the group which received adjuvant radiotherapy was 62.5 and 94.4% for those which did not (p = .014). Preserving the ovaries had no adverse effect on the recurrence of stage I disease. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Due to the rarity of the disease and the common postoperative diagnosis, only retrospective studies have been reported on low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. This disease is commonly diagnosed in premenopausal patients during the early stage. There is no consensus on preserving the ovaries, particularly in young patients, due to the tumour's hormonal characteristics and the risk of late recurrences. What do the results of this study add? Ovarian preservation had no effect on the recurrence of stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Lymphadenectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment had no effect on DFS, and adjuvant radiotherapy decreased DFS in the current study. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

PI3K-activated tumors recurred earlier than other subgroups, but had intermediate long-term outcome. Among low-grade tumors, HH and TRAF7 meningiomas exhibited elevated recurrence compared to other subgroups. Recurrence of NF2 tumors was associated with male gender, high-grade, and elevated Ki-67.

Melatonin might be able to change the pathophysiological process and prognosis into a positive way that might prevent and heal endometrial hyperplasia, which is the first stage of endometrial cancer. For this perspective, we tried to investigate the effect of melatonin on uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in an experimental rat model. Forty Wistar-Albino rats were undergone bilateral oophorectomy and randomized into four groups. To create a model of uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in all groups, except the control group [C] (n = 10), 4 mg/kg/day estradiol hemihydrate were given for 14 days. The uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia was evaluated histopathologically in the left uterine horns, then the groups were treated for 14 days as follows; melatonin (10 mg/kg/day/po) [M] (n = 10), melatonin + estradiol hemihydrate (10 mg/kg/day/po and 4 mg/kg/day/po) [M + E] (n = 10), and dark environment [D] (n = 10).

Leveraging a 3D rat primary neural organotypic in vitro model (rat brainsphere), we compare developmental neurotoxic effects of BDE-47-the most abundant PBDE congener-with four OPFR (isopropylated phenyl phosphate-IPP, triphenyl phosphate-TPHP, isodecyl diphenyl phosphate-IDDP, and tricresyl phosphate (also known as trimethyl phenyl phosphate)-TMPP). Employing mass spectroscopy-based metabolomics and transcriptomics, we observe at similar human-relevant non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.1-5 µM) stronger developmental neurotoxic effects by OPFR. This includes toxicity to neurons in the low µM range; all FR decrease the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (except BDE-47 and TPHP). Furthermore, n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), considered a neurologic diagnostic molecule, was decreased by all OPFR. At similar concentrations, the FR currently in use decreased plasma membrane dopamine active transporter expression, while BDE-47 did not. Several findings suggest astrogliosis induced by the OPFR, but not BDE-47. At the 5 µM concentrations, the OPFR more than BDE-47 interfered with myelination. An increase of cytokine gene and receptor expressions suggests that exposure to OPFR may induce an inflammatory response.

Papillary tumor of the pineal region is considered one of four pineal parenchymal tumors according to the 2007 World Health Organisation classification of central nervous system tumors. It is mostly seen in the middle age and it is rare under the age of 17 in the literature. In this report, we aim to present a case with papillary tumor of the pineal region with both CT and MRI findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis. Case report: A 17-year-old female patient who underwent a treatment of ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus 18 months ago applied to the neurosurgery clinic with nausea, vomiting, sensorineural hearing loss and Parinaud syndrome continuing through 1 month. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been applied. A 58x31x38 mm mass with cystic and mild hyperdense soft tissue components was observed in the localization of pineal gland and posterior comissure on non-enhanced CT. MRI examination revealed that the mass filled the pineal region, contained solid and large cystic components, and hyperintense on T1-weighted images. After intravenous contrast media injection, the mass enhanced more peripherally. DW-MRI showed that there is a diffusion restriction in some parts of the soft tissue components. The mass was totally resected, and pathology report revealed that it is a papillary tumor of the pineal region.

While its prognosis is generally favorable, disease recurrence is relatively frequent. Because morbidity after repeated surgery may be significant, an optimized prediction of recurrence-free survival (RFS) has the potential to improve current management strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the Ki-67 proliferation index with respect to RFS in patients with DFSP. We retrospectively analyzed data from 45 patients with DFSP. We calculated the Ki-67 proliferation index as the percentage of immunostained nuclei among the total number of tumor cell nuclei regardless of the intensity of immunostaining. We constructed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify predictors of RFS. Among the 45 patients included in the study, 8 developed local recurrences and 2 had lung metastases (median follow-up: 95.0 months; range: 5.2-412.4 months). The RFS rates at 60, 120, and 240 months of follow-up were 83.8%, 76.2%, and 65.3%, respectively. The median Ki-67 proliferation index was 14%. Notably, we identified the Ki-67 proliferation index as the only independent predictor for RFS in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio = 1.106, 95% confidence interval = 1.019-1.200, p = 0.016).

A Literature Review and Case Report.,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,"The relationship between the endocrine system and autoimmunity has been recognized for a long time and one of the best examples of autoimmune endocrine disease is autoimmune hypophysitis. A better understanding of autoimmune mechanisms and radiological, biochemical, and immunological developments have given rise to the definition of new autoimmune disorders including autoimmunity-related hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. However, whether hypothalamitis may occur as a distinct entity, is still matter of debate. Here we describe a 35-year-old woman with growing suprasellar mass, partial empty sella, central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, and hyperprolactinemia. Histopathologic examination of surgically removed suprasellar mass revealed lymphocytic infiltrate suggestive of an autoimmune disease with hypothalamic involvement. The presence of anti-hypothalamus antibodies to AVP-secreting cells (AVPcAb) at high titers and the absence of anti-pituitary antibodies suggested the diagnosis of isolated hypothalamitis. Some similar conditions have sometimes been reported in the literature but the simultaneous double finding of lymphocytic infiltrate and the presence of AVPcAb so far has never been reported. We think that the hypothalamitis can be considered a new isolated autoimmune disease affecting the hypothalamus while the lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis can be a consequence of hypothalamitis with subsequent autoimmune involvement of the pituitary. To our knowledge this is the first observation of autoimmune hypothalamic involvement with central diabetes insipidus, partial empty sella, anti-hypothalamic antibodies and hypopituitarism.",eng,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,0375362,0021-972X,aheadofprint,33104773,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,NA,NA,J Clin Endocrinol Metab

In ovarian cases, more MCs were counted overall in the necrotizing group, but there were fewer vascular structures. The increase in the number of MC and vascular structures in lungs and stomach in the non-necrotizing group supports the theory that MCs are involved in tumor progression.

INH treatment also increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activities of p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) while decreasing levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Double immunofluorescence expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in brain tissues were increased after INH administration. Furthermore, INH increased mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm), glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), NF-κB, TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GFAP in rat brain tissues. Co-treatment with CR increased anti-oxidant capacity as well as regulated inflammation and apoptosis in brain. Additionally, molecular docking results showed that CR had the potential to interact with the active sites of TNF-α and NFκ-B. In conclusion, CR improved INH-induced brain oxidative damage, inflammation and apoptosis, possibly through their antioxidant properties.",eng,Neurotoxicology,7905589,0161-813X,ppublish,33121995,10.1016/j.neuro.2020.10.009,81,NA,Neurotoxicology

Regarding these parameters, in cisplatin group NF-ƘB, MDA and TOS levels were statistically significantly increased with cisplatin administration and giving taxifolin concomitantly with cisplatin prevented this elevation. On the other hand, tGSH and TAS levels were statistically significantly decreased with cisplatin administration and routine simultaneous application of taxifolin with cisplatin prevented this decrease. In histopathological findings, haemorrhage was observed in the perineum of the injured optic nerves in the cisplatin treated group. And also edoema and degeneration in nerve fascicles in damaged optic nerves were seen in the cisplatin group. In the taxifolin treated group histopathological examinations were close to normal appearance, except mild edoema in nerve fascicles.

Investigating other specific substrates of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities may illuminate how it performs these diverse functions in mammalian cells. We report that macrophage IRE1 plays an unprecedented role in regulating phosphatidylinositide-derived signaling lipid metabolites and has profound impact on the downstream signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This cross-talk between UPR and mTOR pathways occurs through the unconventional maturation of microRNA (miR) 2137 by IRE1's RNase activity.

In addition to that, poststroke neuroregeneration is stimulated upon transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium further enhances the neuroregenerative potential of MSCs, which act by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs). The present work analyzed, whether MSC preconditioning with lithium modifies EV secretion patterns, enhancing the therapeutic potential of such derived EVs (Li-EVs) in comparison with EVs enriched from native MSCs. Indeed, Li-EVs significantly enhanced the resistance of cultured astrocytes, microglia, and neurons against hypoxic injury when compared with controls and to native EV-treated cells. Using a stroke mouse model, intravenous delivery of Li-EVs increased neurological recovery and neuroregeneration for as long as 3 months in comparison with controls and EV-treated mice, albeit the latter also showed significantly better behavioral test performance compared with controls. Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium also changed the secretion patterns for such EVs, modifying the contents of various miRNAs within these vesicles. As such, Li-EVs displayed significantly increased levels of miR-1906, which has been shown to be a new regulator of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Li-EVs reduced posthypoxic and postischemic TLR4 abundance, resulting in an inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, decreased proteasomal activity, and declined both inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, all of which culminating in reduced levels of poststroke cerebral inflammation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in termination of IL2 activation are largely unknown in human NK cells. PR/SET domain 1 was previously reported to decrease cell growth and increase apoptosis in an IL2-dependent manner in malignant NK cell lines, suggesting the possibility of down-regulation of IL2 signaling pathway gene(s) through direct transcriptional repression. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified a PRDM1 binding site on the first intron of CD25 (IL2RA), which codes for the IL2 receptor subunit regulating sensitivity to IL2 signaling, in primary NK cells activated with engineered K562 cells or IL2. Ectopic expression of PRDM1 down-regulated CD25 expression at transcript and protein levels in two PRDM1 nonexpressing NK cell lines. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD25 in two malignant NK cell lines led to progressive depletion of NK cells in low IL2 concentrations. By contrast, ectopic CD25 expression in primary human NK cells led to progressive increase in cell number in CD25-transduced cells in low IL2 concentrations. Altogether these results reveal a pivotal role of PRDM1 in inhibition of IL2-induced NK cell expansion through direct repression of CD25 in activated human NK cells. These observations provide additional support for the role of PRDM1 in attenuation of NK cell activation and growth, with implications on neoplastic transformation or NK cell function when it is deregulated.",eng,J Leukoc Biol,8405628,0741-5400,aheadofprint,33145806,10.1002/JLB.2A0520-321RR,NA,NA,J Leukoc Biol

In recent years, many studies revealed the inflammatory nature of endometriosis. Many of the immune cells and their secretory products cytokines and chemokines has been detected in body fluids of women with endometriosis. Cytokines are protein or glycoprotein in structures and hormon-like molecules that act generally in a paracrine fashion to regulate immun responses.

Recently, studies have demonstrated substantial variation between countries in terms of their approach to sampling gallbladders, and furthermore, that pathologists from different continents apply highly variable criteria in determining stage of invasion in this organ. These findings raised the question of whether these variations in pathologic evaluation could account for the vastly different survival rates of T2 GBC reported in the literature. In this study, survival of 316 GBCs from three countries (Chile n = 137, South Korea n = 105, USA n = 74), all adequately sampled (with a minimum of five tumor sections examined) and histopathologically verified as pT2 (after consensus examination by expert pathologists from three continents), was analyzed. Chilean patients had a significantly worse prognosis based on 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.83, p = 0.002) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.51-3.84, p &lt; 0.001), compared to their South Korean counterparts, even when controlled for age and sex. Comparing the USA to South Korea, the survival differences in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75, p = 0.015) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.14-3.31, p = 0.015) were also pronounced. The 3-year disease-specific survival rates in South Korea, the USA, and Chile were 75%, 65%, and 55%, respectively, the 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 50%, respectively, and the overall 5-year survival rates were 55%, 45%, and 35%, respectively. In conclusion, the survival of true T2 GBC in properly classified cases is neither as good nor as bad as previously documented in the literature and shows notable geographic differences even in well-sampled cases with consensus histopathologic criteria.

Mature teratomas are the most common subtype and develop from well-differentiated germ cells. Although the location is extragonadal in infants and young children, gonadal involvement occurs in adults. Midline defects can be diagnosed on prenatal imaging. In this case report, a newborn with mature cystic teratoma and a prenatal lumbar midline closure defect was presented. The perinatal preliminary diagnosis was meningomyelocele. However, a cystic sac containing exophytic solid tumoral tissues approximately 5 × 5 × 3 cm in size was seen macroscopically in the lumbar region after the birth, and this tumor was totally resected. After tumor excision, spina bifida aperta and vertebral exophytic bony tissue compatible with diastematomyelia were observed at the bottom of the surgical field and were totally resected. In the short-term follow-up, no additional problem occurred. The histopathological diagnosis was &quot;mature cystic teratoma.&quot; In conclusion, extragonadal teratoma accompanying diastematomyelia could easily be mistaken for meningomyelocele or other common malformations.

The hypoxic condition is a consequence of an imbalance between rapidly proliferating cells and a vascularization that leads to lower oxygen levels in tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an essential transcription factor contributing to the regulation of hypoxia-associated genes. Some of these genes modulate molecular cascades associated with the Warburg effect and its accompanying pathways and, therefore, represent promising targets for cancer treatment. Current progress in the development of therapeutic approaches brings several promising inhibitors of HIF-1. Flavonoids, widely occurring in various plants, exert a broad spectrum of beneficial effects on human health, and are potentially powerful therapeutic tools against cancer. Recent evidences identified numerous natural flavonoids and their derivatives as inhibitors of HIF-1, associated with the regulation of critical glycolytic components in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase II (HKII), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we discuss the results of most recent studies evaluating the impact of flavonoids on HIF-1 accompanied by the regulation of critical enzymes contributing to the Warburg phenotype. Besides, flavonoid effects on glucose metabolism via regulation of HIF-1 activity represent a promising avenue in cancer-related research. At the same time, only more-in depth investigations can further elucidate the mechanistic and clinical connections between HIF-1 and cancer metabolism.",eng,Cancers (Basel),101526829,2072-6694,epublish,33401572,10.3390/cancers13010130,13,1,Cancers (Basel)

Among 823 thyroidectomy specimens with PTC diagnosed between 2015 and 2018, 121 tumors from 105 patients (12.75%) were reclassified as encapsulated conventional PTC. In 76 patients, tumors were unifocal. Size, cystic changes, background thyroiditis, psammoma bodies, cervical lymph node metastasis at presentation, capsular/vascular invasion, and immunohistochemical BRAF-V600E expression were evaluated. Ninety-two non-encapsulated conventional PTCs served as control group. Encapsulated cases were predominantly women (73.3%), 56.4% were microcarcinomas, 97.5% had cystic changes, 81.4% were BRAF-V600E positive, and 36.8% of unifocal encapsulated tumors had cervical lymph node metastasis. Thyroiditis and psammoma bodies were detected in nearly half of the encapsulated PTCs. Fourteen percent of the unifocal tumors showed total encapsulation, whereas capsular and vascular invasion was detected in 85.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Encapsulated cases did not show any significant difference from the control group, except for prominent cystic changes (p &lt; 0.001). Relationship between lymph node metastasis at presentation and capsular invasion was statistically significant (p = 0.001), and metastasis was more frequent in cases with extensive capsular invasion (no/minimal invasion versus extensive invasion, p &lt; 0.001). Cystic changes are very common, and this feature deserves mentioning as a morphological characteristic of encapsulated conventional PTCs.

Patient-related factors determining the outcome in SM are largely unknown. Methods: We examined the impact of sex on the clinical features, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in 3403 patients with mastocytosis collected in the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM). The impact of cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations on sex differences was analyzed in a subset of patients. Results: Of all patients enrolled, 55.3% were females. However, a male predominance was found in a subset of advanced SM (AdvSM) patients, namely SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN, 70%; p &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, organomegaly (male: 23% vs. female: 13%, p = 0.007) was more, whereas skin involvement (male: 71% vs. female: 86%, p = 0.001) was less frequent in males. In all patients together, OS (p &lt; 0.0001) was significantly inferior in males, and also within the WHO sub-categories indolent SM, aggressive SM (ASM) and SM-AHN.

Besides genetic factors, aging, ultraviolet rays, sex hormones, calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus and systemic steroids, play a role in the development of sebaceous hyperplasia. Cyclosporin is widely used in organ transplant patients. Acne, keratosis pilaris, sebaceous hyperplasia and epidermoid cysts, which are rare side effects, are frequently seen in renal transplant patients and it is suggested that the pilosebaceous unit develops as a result of occlusion with keratinous material. It is thought that cyclosporine causes these side effects by increasing the secretion of sebum and 5-alpha reductase enzyme activity.

An imbalance of CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) is critical in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Although cytokine control of this process is well understood, transcriptional regulation is not. KLF10, a member of the Kruppel-like transcription factor family, is an emerging regulator of immune cell function. We generated CD4+-T-cell-specific KLF10 knockout (TKO) mice and identified a predisposition to obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver due to defects of CD4+ Treg mobilization to liver and adipose tissue depots and decreased transforming growth factor β3 (TGF-β3) release in vitro and in vivo. Adoptive transfer of wild-type CD4+ Tregs fully rescued obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver. Mechanistically, TKO Tregs exhibit reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTOR signaling, and consequently impaired chemotactic properties. Collectively, our study identifies CD4+ T cell KLF10 as an essential regulator of obesity and insulin resistance by altering Treg metabolism and mobilization.",eng,Cell Rep,101573691,NA,ppublish,33378664,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108550,33,13,Cell Rep

In biochemical analysis of testicular tissue, it was found that PbAc-reduced antioxidant parameters [glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)], while it increased lipid peroxidation, inflammatory markers [nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)], and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In the immunohistochemical examination, it was determined that PbAc increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3. Accordingly, PbAc was found to cause a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in the percentage of dead sperm. However, it has been observed that CHR relieves oxidative stress due to its antioxidant properties, thus protecting against inflammation and apoptosis. It also allowed the CHR sperm parameters to return to control group levels. The results revealed that CHR could be a natural substance to be used in Pb-induced testicular toxicity.

Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the damage caused by Pb to testicular tissue. CHR is an antioxidant substance that occurs naturally in various plants and has various pharmacological properties.

Out of 46 patients tested, 34 (76%) had autoantibodies, with NXP2 (21.7%), followed by TIF1g (17.4%), MDA5 (8.7%), and Mi-2 (8.7%). Presence of TIF1g and NXP2 indicated a severe course; and Ku a much severe course compared to previous studies. Corticosteroids (100%) combined with methotrexate (93%) was the initial treatment. Biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were used in 22% of the cohort. Calcinosis (36%) was the most common long-term complication, associated with disease onset ≤6 years, higher muscle biopsy scores and MDA5 positivity. Complete remission was achieved in 65.5% of the patients in a median 24 (IQR 11.8-42.5) months with a relapse rate of 26.3%. 43.9% of NXP2 and 33.3% of TIF-1 g positive patients had a relapse.

Here, we investigated the role of indirect cholinergic activation on PCa progression through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via clinically available AChE-inhibitors, i.e. physostigmine and pyridostigmine.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We applied immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, MTT-viability, invasion, flow-cytometric-cell-cycle-assays, phospho-kinase arrays, multiplex ELISA and xenografted mice to assess the impact of AChE inhibition on PCa cell growth and invasiveness, and tumor-associated inflammation. Survival analyses were performed in a novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable mouse model of PCa under adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine+/-physostigmine/pyridostigmine (n = 30 mice). Human PCa specimens (n = 39) were analyzed for the impact of cancer AChE expression on tumor stage and survival.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":We discovered a strong expression of AChE in cancer cells of human PCa specimens. Inhibition of this cancer-cell-intrinsic AChE via pyridostigmine and physostigmine, or administration of acetylcholine (ACh), diminished PCa cell viability and invasion in vitro and in vivo via suppression of pERK signaling, and reduced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable PCa mouse model, adjuvant co-therapy with AChE blockers had no impact on survival. Accordingly, survival of resected PCa patients did not differ based on tumor AChE expression levels. Patients with higher-stage PCa also exhibited loss of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme, choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), in their nerves.

Most of the studies investigating PD-L1 expression in endometrial carcinoma have used tissue microarrays and did not examine all tumor blocks. In this study, we analyzed the expression of PD-L1 in resection specimens of 176 consecutive endometrial carcinomas using all tumor blocks; we compared PD-L1 expression in MMR-deficient endometrial carcinomas, including the MLH1 and PMS2-loss subgroup, and the other MMR-loss subgroups (MSH2 and MSH6, isolated PMS2, and isolated MSH6), with the MMR-intact subgroup. MLH1 methylation was performed in tumors with MLH1 and PMS2 loss. Tumor cell (TC) and tumor-associated immune cell (IC) PD-L1 positivity with a 1% cutoff was observed in 21% (n=37) and 66.5% (n=117) of cases, respectively, and with a 5% cutoff in 5.1% (n=9) and 39.8% (n=70) of cases, respectively.

Vasopressin acts primarily to reabsorb water via urinary concentration. However, fat is also a source of metabolic water, raising the possibility that vasopressin might have a role in fat accumulation. Fructose has also been reported to stimulate vasopressin. Here we tested the hypothesis that fructose induced metabolic syndrome is mediated by vasopressin. Orally administered fructose, glucose or high fructose corn syrup increased vasopressin (copeptin) concentrations and was mediated by fructokinase, an enzyme specific for fructose metabolism. Suppressing vasopressin with hydration both prevented and ameliorated fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. The vasopressin effects were mediated by the Vasopressin 1b receptor, as Vasopressin 1b receptor knockout mice were completely protected while V1a knockout paradoxically showed worse metabolic syndrome. The mechanism is likely mediated in part by de novo expression of V1b in the liver that amplifies fructokinase expression in response to fructose. Thus, our studies document a new role for vasopressin in water conservation via the accumulation of fat as a source of metabolic water. Clinically, it also suggests that increased water intake may be a beneficial way to both prevent or treat metabolic syndrome.",eng,JCI Insight,101676073,2379-3708,aheadofprint,33320834,10.1172/jci.insight.140848,NA,NA,JCI Insight

The neuroprotective cargo of EVs, however, has not yet been identified. To investigate such cargo and its underlying mechanism, primary neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) and cocultured with adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) or ADMSC-secreted EVs. Under such conditions, both ADMSCs and ADMSC-secreted EVs significantly reduced neuronal death. Screening for signalling cascades being involved in the interaction between ADMSCs and neurons revealed a decreased autophagic flux as well as a declined p53-BNIP3 activity in neurons receiving either treatment paradigm. However, the aforementioned effects were reversed when ADMSCs were pretreated with the inhibitor of exosomal secretion GW4869 or when Hrs was knocked down. In light of miR-25-3p being the most highly expressed miRNA in ADMSC-EVs interacting with the p53 pathway, further in vitro work focused on this pathway. Indeed, a miR-25-3p oligonucleotide mimic reduced cell death, whereas the anti-oligonucleotide increased autophagic flux and cell death by modulating p53-BNIP3 signalling in primary neurons exposed to OGD. Likewise, native ADMSC-EVs but not EVs obtained from ADMSCs pretreated with the anti-miR-25-3p oligonucleotide (ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p) confirmed the aforementioned in vitro observations in C57BL/6 mice exposed to cerebral ischemia. The infarct size was reduced, and neurological recovery was increased in mice treated with native ADMSC-EVs when compared to ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p. ADMSCs induce neuroprotection by improved autophagic flux through secreted EVs containing miR-25-3p. Hence, our work uncovers a novel key factor in naturally secreted ADMSC-EVs for the regulation of autophagy and induction of neuroprotection in a preclinical stroke model.",eng,J Extracell Vesicles,101610479,2001-3078,ppublish,33304476,10.1002/jev2.12024,10,1,J Extracell Vesicles

To explore gliomagenesis, we hypothesized that gliomas with different underlying oncogenic mechanisms would have differences in the burden of various forms of these genomic alterations. This was an analysis on adult diffuse gliomas, but IDH-mutant gliomas as well as diffuse midline gliomas H3-K27M were excluded to search for the possible presence of new entities among the very heterogenous group of IDH-WT glioblastomas. The cohort was divided into two molecular subsets: (1) Molecularly-defined GBM (mGBM) as those that carried molecular features of glioblastomas (including TERT promoter mutations, 7/10 pattern, or EGFR-amplification), and (2) those who did not (others). Whole exome sequencing was performed for 37 primary tumors and matched blood samples as well as 8 recurrences. Single nucleotide variations (SNV), short insertion or deletions (indels) and copy number alterations (CNA) were quantified using 5 quantitative metrics (SNV burden, indel burden, copy number alteration frequency-wGII, chromosomal arm event ratio-CAER, copy number amplitude) as well as 4 parameters that explored underlying oncogenic mechanisms (chromothripsis, double minutes, microsatellite instability and mutational signatures).

However, the role of KA in ER stress-associated development of NAFLD has not been fully explored. In the current study, we observed decreased KA levels in the serum of obese subjects. Treated hepatocytes with KA attenuated palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and downregulated lipogenesis-associated genes as well as ER stress markers in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, KA augmented AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) expression, and autophagy markers. The small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and ORP150, or 3-methyladenine also abrogated the effects of KA on ER stress and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In accordance with in vitro observations, KA administration to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes as well as ER stress. Moreover, KA treatment increased hepatic AMPK phosphorylation, ORP150 expression, and autophagy related markers in mouse livers. Knockdown of AMPK using in vivo transfection mitigated the effects of KA on hepatic steatosis and ER stress as well as autophagy and ORP150 expression. These results suggest that KA ameliorates hepatic steatosis via the AMPK/autophagy- and AMPK/ORP150-mediated suppression of ER stress.

In the current study, the effect of montelukast on depression-like behavior in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model was investigated. A total of 3 OVA challenges were applied at 2 week intervals for the persistence of asthma. Depression-like behavior was assessed using forced swim tests following each challenge and locomotor activities were evaluated using open field tests. At the end of the current study, plasma montelukast concentrations were measured and the development of asthma and effect of montelukast treatment were histopathologically examined. Inflammation scores that were increased in the OVA mice following all challenges were indicated to be reduced by montelukast treatment. The immobility time of mice increased beginning with the first challenge and this was also reduced by montelukast treatment. Montelukast administration to the control mice did not alter immobility times. Moreover, motor activity of the OVA and montelukast-treated mice were not altered. The results indicated there was no association between chronic montelukast treatment and depression. Furthermore, the chronic administration of montelukast to non-asthmatic mice did not increase immobility. However, depressive behavior increased at all time points in the OVA mice.

Since oxidative stress causes pathological changes in neuronal structures antioxidant compounds gained significant attention the last decades. Although several antioxidant compounds showed neuroprotective actions in Parkinson's disease models, only a few of them demonstrated protective effects against loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons. Idebenone is an analog of the well-known antioxidant compound coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Clinical safety of idebenone is well described, and due to its high antioxidant capacity currently used to treat Freidrich's ataxia and Alzheimer's disease. Like Parkinson's disease, these diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial balance in neurons. However, knowledge about the effects of idebenone on Parkinson's disease is limited. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate and delineate the possible effects of idebenone in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease models. Idebenone (200 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the decrease of striatal expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase[quinone]-1, which is an essential element for mitochondrial respiration. Idebenone decreased the striatal levels of the lipid peroxidation products and increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx-4), which is primarily known for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, idebenone mitigated motor impairment and increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron survival. Together our results thus indicate that that idebenone has protective effects against a rotenone insult with pleiotropic actions on the cellular oxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation.",eng,Neurochem Res,7613461,0364-3190,aheadofprint,33247801,10.1007/s11064-020-03186-w,NA,NA,Neurochem Res

Rejuveinix (RJX) is an intravenous formulation of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Its active ingredients include ascorbic acid, cyanocobalamin, thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin 5' phosphate, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and calcium D-pantothenate. RJX is being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant treatment platform for patients with sepsis, including COVID-19 patients with viral sepsis and ARDS. Here, we report its clinical safety profile in a phase 1 clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) and its potent protective activity in the lipopolysaccharide galactosamine (LPS-GalN) mouse model of ARDS. Methods: A phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-part, ascending dose-escalation study was performed in participating 76 healthy volunteer human subjects in compliance with the ICH (E6) good clinical practice guidelines to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RJX (Protocol No. RPI003; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105). The ability of RJX to prevent fatal shock, ARDS, and multi-organ failure was examined in the well-established LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Standard methods were employed for the statistical analysis of data in both studies. Findings: In the phase 1 clinical study, no participant developed serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 3-Grade 4 adverse events (AEs) or prematurely discontinued participation in the study. In the non-clinical study, RJX exhibited potent and dose-dependent protective activity, decreased the inflammatory cytokine responses (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta), and improved survival in the LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Histopathological examinations showed that RJX attenuated the LPS-GalN induced acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary edema as well as liver damage. Conclusion: RJX showed a very favorable safety profile and tolerability in human subjects. It shows potential to favorably affect the clinical course of high-risk COVID-19 by preventing ARDS and its complications.",eng,Front Pharmacol,101548923,1663-9812,epublish,33244300,10.3389/fphar.2020.594321,11,NA,Front Pharmacol

For this purpose, 40 male Wistar albino rats were used. The animals were assigned to the following 4 groups: control group (received corn oil vehicle alone), diosmin-treated group (50 mg/kg bw/day orally), deltamethrin-exposed group (5 mg/kg bw/day, orally) and coadministered group (5 mg/kg bw/day deltamethrin and 50 mg/kg bw/day diosmin, orally) for 28 days. Some lipid peroxidation/antioxidant status/biochemical markers were evaluated in blood/tissue (liver, kidney, brain, heart and testis) samples and the histopathological architecture was assessed. Compared with the control group, no alteration was detected in the parameters and histological findings of the diosmin-treated group. Deltamethrin toxicity was associated with significantly increased plasma, cardiac, hepatic, renal, cerebral and testicular levels of MDA and NO, and significantly decreased GSH levels (p &lt; 0.05). Antioxidant enzyme status (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities) displayed either decrease or increase (p &lt; 0.05). Significant increase was detected in AST and ALT activities and urea and creatinine levels (p &lt; 0.05). The values of the group coadministered with deltamethrin and diosmin were similar to the values of the control group. Diosmin ameliorated deltamethrin-induced lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration and subendocardial oedema in the heart.

Transcriptomic profiling studies have thus far revealed the presence of molecular subtypes of AML that are not accounted for by standard clinical parameters or by routinely used biomarkers. Such molecular subtypes of AML are predicted to vary in response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is an important group of proteins that play a critical role in regulating blood pressure, vascular resistance and fluid/electrolyte balance. RAS pathway genes are also known to be present locally in tissues such as the bone marrow, where they play an important role in leukemic hematopoiesis. In this study, we asked if the RAS genes could be utilized to predict drug responses in patients with AML. We show that the combined in silico analysis of up to five RAS genes can reliably predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin as well as Etoposide in AML. The same genes could also predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin when tested in vitro. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of TNF-alpha and type-I IFN response genes among sensitive, and TGF-beta and fibronectin related genes in resistant cancer cells. However, this does not seem to reflect an epithelial to mesenchymal transition per se. We also identified that RAS genes can stratify patients with AML into subtypes with distinct prognosis.

Although endometriosis is known as a benign disease, it has demonstrated characteristics of malignant neoplasms, including neoangiogenesis, tissue invasion, and cell implantation to distant organs. Octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct-4) is a molecular marker for stem cells that plays an essential role in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal processes in various types of benign and malignant tissues. CD44 is a multifunctional cell surface adhesion molecule that acts as an integral cell membrane protein and plays a role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. E-cadherin is an epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecule that plays important role in the modulation of cell polarization, cell migration, and cancer metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of Oct-4, CD44, and E-cadherin in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues from women with endometrioma compared to control endometrial tissues from women without endometrioma.

Previously (Geiser et al. 2013; Phytopathology 103:400-408. 2013), the Fusarium community voiced near unanimous support for a concept of Fusarium that represented a clade comprising all agriculturally and clinically important Fusarium species, including the F. solani Species Complex (FSSC). Subsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard et al. 2015 Studies in Mycology 80: 189-245) who proposed dividing Fusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus Neocosmospora, with subsequent justification based on claims that the Geiser et al. (2013) concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic (Sandoval-Denis et al. 2018; Persoonia 41:109-129). Here we test this claim, and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as Neocosmospora were recombined in Fusarium, and nine others were renamed Fusarium.

Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis. Our results show that a random forest based approach can distinguish samples with tumor cells and controls accurately and effectively with a median AUC of 85.6% and AUPR of 93.4%. We also show that we can further distinguish benign and malignant samples with a median AUC of 87.1% and AUPR of 96.1%. We analyze the feature (peak) importance for classification to interpret the results of the classifier.

MSI status is assessed to detect Lynch syndrome, guide adjuvant chemotherapy, determine prognosis, and use as a companion test for checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Traditionally, MSI status is determined by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. The Idylla™ MSI Assay is a fully automated molecular method (including automated result interpretation), using seven novel MSI biomarkers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A, SULF2) and not requiring matched normal tissue. In this real-world global study, 44 clinical centers performed Idylla™ testing on a total of 1301 archived colorectal cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and compared Idylla™ results against available results from routine diagnostic testing in those sites. MSI mutations detected with the Idylla™ MSI Assay were equally distributed over the seven biomarkers, and 84.48% of the MSI-high samples had ≥ 5 mutated biomarkers, while 98.25% of the microsatellite-stable samples had zero mutated biomarkers. The concordance level between the Idylla™ MSI Assay and immunohistochemistry was 96.39% (988/1025); 17/37 discordant samples were found to be concordant when a third method was used. Compared with routine molecular methods, the concordance level was 98.01% (789/805); third-method analysis found concordance for 8/16 discordant samples. The failure rate of the Idylla™ MSI Assay (0.23%; 3/1301) was lower than that of referenced immunohistochemistry (4.37%; 47/1075) or molecular assays (0.86%; 7/812). In conclusion, lower failure rates and high concordance levels were found between the Idylla™ MSI Assay and routine tests.",eng,Virchows Arch,9423843,0945-6317,aheadofprint,33170334,10.1007/s00428-020-02962-x,NA,NA,Virchows Arch
