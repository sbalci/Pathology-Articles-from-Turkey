Tumors located exclusively in the deep lobe are not common and 20% of parotid gland tumors originate from deep lobe under the branches of the facial nerve. Accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) procedure in salivary gland tumors have been studied extensively, however there isn't any data regarding usefulness of FNAB in tumors located exclusively in deep lobe of parotid gland. In this study we aimed to assess the use of FNAB in deep lobe parotid tumors.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with deep lobe parotid tumors who underwent surgery in our clinic between January 2013-December 2018. Characteristics of patients were recorded. Preoperative FNAB results and postoperative final histopathologic diagnosis were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 24.0 was used for statistical analysis.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The number of patients that met the inclusion criteria was 51. The mean age of patients were 49.2(14-86). In 40 (78.4) of the patients, tumor was reported as benign and in 11 (21.6) patients FNAB diagnosis was suspicious for malignancy, malignant or non-diagnostic. In final histopathologic diagnosis, 42 of the tumors were benign and 9 were malignant. The most common benign tumor type was pleomorphic adenoma which constitutes 27 of the cases (52.9%). Regarding detection of malignant disease, the sensitivity of FNAB was 90.4%, specificity was 77.7%, positive predictive value was 95%, negative predictive value was 63.6%. There was a substantial agreement between FNAB and final histopathologic diagnosis(kappa = 0,628).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":FNAB is a safe and reliable tool to evaluate deep lobe parotid tumors. It is an important part of preoperative surgical planning and can help the surgeon in patient counseling. FNAB with ultrasound guidance is recommended for deep lobe tumors.",eng,Am J Otolaryngol,8000029,0196-0709,ppublish,33045535,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102590,42,1,Am J Otolaryngol

Here we report that activin-A, after binding to its cognate receptors induces a functional luteolytic state and reverses luteinization phenotype by downregulating the expression of the steroidogenic enzymes, LH receptor and VEGF and reducing estradiol (E2) progesterone (P4) production and upregulating FSH receptor and cyclin D1 expression in human primary luteinized granulosa cells. Further, this action of activin-A involves downregulation of JNK signaling pathway and is opposite to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which acts as a luteotropic hormone and improves luteal function through the activation of JNK pathway in the same cell type. Reversal of luteinization phenotype in luteal granulosa cells by activin-A potentially makes this hormone an attractive candidate for use under certain clinical situations, where induction of luteolysis and rapid reduction of endogenous sex steroid levels are beneficial such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), in which the ovaries hyper-respond to gonadotropin stimulation by producing too many growing follicles along with development of ascites, pleural effusion, and hemo-concentrations as a result of increased vascular permeability and leakage of intravascular volume into third spaces.

However, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems exist, and consensus is lacking as to which system represents best practice. An international consensus meeting on TRS took place in November 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, we provide an overview of the outcomes and consensus statements that originated from this meeting. Consensus (≥80% agreement) was reached on a total of seven statements: (1) TRS is important because it provides information about the effect of neoadjuvant treatment that is not provided by other histopathology-based descriptors. (2) TRS for resected PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy should assess residual (viable) tumor burden instead of tumor regression. (3) The CAP scoring system is considered the most adequate scoring system to date because it is based on the presence and amount of residual cancer cells instead of tumor regression. (4) The defining criteria of the categories in the CAP scoring system should be improved by replacing subjective terms including &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot; with objective criteria to evaluate the extent of viable tumor. (5) The improved, consensus-based system should be validated retrospectively and prospectively. (6) Prospective studies should determine the extent of tissue sampling that is required to ensure adequate assessment of the residual cancer burden, taking into account the heterogeneity of tumor response.

The protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase-1 (NQO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were measured with ELISA; the immunopositivity of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and caspase 3 were determined with immunohistochemistry; the mRNA transcript levels of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase 3, protein kinase B1/2 (Akt-1/2), and forkhead box transcription factor, class O1 (FOXO1) were determined with RT-PCR. The reduction of Nrf2 levels and HO-1 and NQO1 activities in the sciatic nerve tissue, the increase in the levels of 8-OHdG, and the increase in the levels of GFAP and NF-κB caused by vincristine was observed to cause oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, neuronal cell damage, and inflammation, respectively. Additionally, vincristine was determined to cause ER stress and apoptosis by increasing PERK, IRE1, ATF-6, and GRP78 and caspase 3 and Bax expressions and by decreasing Bcl-2 expressions. Vincristine causing Akt inhibition also shows that it prevents neuronal survival.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Median duration of disease onset after the ABS was 16 (8-38) months. After the diagnosis of GM was obtained, all patients received steroid treatment. Median steroid treatment duration was 10 (8-20) weeks. Methotrexate was administered in two patients due to persistent breast mass and steroid side effect. Surgical excision was performed in three patients with wide excision. No patient needed further surgery such as mastectomy. Median follow-up period was 37.5 (18-70) months.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This is the first study to declare GM in patients who underwent ABS. Atypical clinical presentation such as breast abscess, mass or fistula after ABS should alert the surgeon about GM. Unlike other mastitis, the primary treatment of this rare disease is steroid and immunosuppressive treatment. Insufficient knowledge about GM can lead to unnecessary surgeries or breast loss.

To determine why individuals with MRS specifically lack pancreatic endocrine cells, we micro-CT imaged a 12-week-old foetus homozygous for the nonsense mutation RFX6 c.1129C&gt;T, which revealed loss of the pancreas body and tail. From this foetus, we derived iPSCs and show that differentiation of these cells in vitro proceeds normally until generation of pancreatic endoderm, which is significantly reduced. We additionally generated an RFX6HA reporter allele by gene targeting in wild-type H9 cells to precisely define RFX6 expression and in parallel performed in situ hybridisation for RFX6 in the dorsal pancreatic bud of a Carnegie stage 14 human embryo. Both in vitro and in vivo, we find that RFX6 specifically labels a subset of PDX1-expressing pancreatic endoderm. In summary, RFX6 is essential for efficient differentiation of pancreatic endoderm, and its absence in individuals with MRS specifically impairs formation of endocrine cells of the pancreas head and tail.",eng,Development,8701744,0950-1991,epublish,33033118,10.1242/dev.194878,147,21,Development

An experimental study.,10.1080/2000656X.2020.1828901,"Recently, most of the immediate breast reconstructions following mastectomy are being carried out with the use of silicone implants. In these patients, methylene blue is being used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. This experimental study was performed to determine the effect of methylene blue on capsular contracture around breast implants. Thirty-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Custom made silicone blocks were placed on the back of animals. In group 1, the incision was closed without performing any additional procedure. In group 2 (control), 0.1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was instilled into the pocket. Group 3 and 4 (study groups) received 0.1 and 0.2 mL of 1% methylene blue, respectively. On postoperative day 60, implants and capsular tissue were extracted. Capsule formation was evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. The histological evaluation included capsule thickness, inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis gradients. Regarding capsule thickness, there were statistically significant differences between groups 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, and 2-4. Although there were more moderate and severe inflammation gradients in groups III and IV, there was no significant difference regarding inflammation severity between control and study groups. In respect of vascular proliferation, there was a statistically significant difference between control and study groups. Similarly, fibrosis gradients were higher in both groups 3 and 4. The study showed that the injection of methylene blue around silicone implants enhanced the formation of capsular contracture. In this case, the degree of contracture was independent of the dose given.

We aimed to assess the association of tumour markers with histopathological structure of ovarian endometriomas to assess their roles in clinical management. Data from 86 women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma were evaluated. The possible risk factors for inadvertently removed normal ovarian parenchyma (IRNOP) during laparoscopic cystectomy and the relationship between tumour markers and histopathologic parameters of ovarian endometrioma were assessed. Age and the depth of penetration of endometrial tissue into the cyst wall showed a significant positive correlation with thickness of IRNOP. There was a significant negative correlation between IRNOP and the thickness of fibrosis on cyst wall. Thickness of fibrosis and the depth of penetration represented significant positive correlations with tumour markers (CA 125, CA 15-3, and CA 19-9), respectively. This is the first study that reveals the association between tumour markers and the histopathologic features of ovarian endometrioma. The outcome of the present study indicated that lower levels of tumour markers may permit a conservative management, rising levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and high levels may help in counselling postoperative outcomes. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Endometriosis is defined as a benign gynaecologic disease, and the vast majority of women who suffer from endometriosis are of reproductive age. Ovarian endometriotic cysts are found in one-fifth to one-half of patients with endometriosis. Laparoscopic cystectomy is accepted as the gold standard for the surgical management of ovarian endometriotic cysts because of the procedure's several clinical advantages, such as lower recurrence and higher pregnancy rates. However, studies have indicated that laparoscopic excision of an ovarian endometrioma capsule could be associated with a reduction in both the ovarian volume and the follicle count. What do the results of this study add? Our retrospective data indicate that tumour markers may have role in planning the management of ovarian endometriomas. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Low tumour markers levels may permit a conservative management, elevating levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and finally high levels may help in counselling the patient about her possible postoperative outcomes.",eng,J Obstet Gynaecol,8309140,0144-3615,aheadofprint,33054460,10.1080/01443615.2020.1791060,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":During the study period, 89 children met the inclusion criteria. Patients were followed for a median of 8.0 years. A total of 39 (44%) patients were diagnosed with EGID after transplantation. Of these, 29 (33%) had eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and 10 (11%) had eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis. In comparison with the non-EGID group, patients with EGID were younger at transplant (P ≤ 0.0001), transplanted more frequently due to biliary atresia (P ≤ 0.0001), and had higher rates of pretransplant allergy (P = 0.019). In the posttransplant period, they had higher rates of mammalian Target of Rapamycin inhibitor use (P = 0.006), Epstein-Barr virus viremia (P = 0.03), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (P = 0.005), and allergen sensitization (P ≤ 0.0001). In regression analysis, young age at transplant, age at diagnosis, pretransplant atopic dermatitis, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease were associated with an increased risk of EGID or EoE. Laboratory abnormalities such as anemia (P = 0.007), thrombocytosis (P = 0.012), and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.031) were more commonly observed in the eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis group than in the EoE group.

Plasma samples were collected on the same day of diagnosis and before any immunosuppressive treatment was initiated. At the time of diagnosis and sample collection, none of the patients had renal involvement. We used Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) to investigate the alterations in plasma metabolomic profiles. Three separate pools were created: healthy controls (group C), active IgAV patients who did not develop renal involvement (group H), and patients who developed IgAVN at follow up (group N).

Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Retrospective database research was conducted. Sixty nine meningioma and 15 schwannoma having DSC-PI between January 2016 and February 2020 were included. Time to signal intensity curves (TSIC) were analyzed and grouped as T1-dominant leakage, T2*-dominant leakage and return to baseline. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative mean transit time (rMTT), percentage signal recovery 1 (PSR 1) and PSR 2 values were calculated. The differences between the groups were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were operated.

The role of oophorectomy is yet to be established. We aimed to examine the effect of preserving the ovaries on the pattern of recurrences in patients with stage I disease. Thirty-four patients with stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma were retrospectively analysed. Based on ovarian preservation the whole cohort was divided into two groups. Recurrence (liver, lung, groin and bone) was detected in 4 (11.8%) cases. No significant differences in overall survival or disease-free survival (DFS) were observed between the ovarian preservation and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) groups. Subset analysis revealed no significant difference in DFS between the ovarian preservation and BSO groups in the premenopausal arm. And also, the performance of pelvic (n = 2) or para-aortic lymphadenectomy (n = 6) or adjuvant hormonal therapy did not alter DFS significantly. The 5-year DFS rate for the group which received adjuvant radiotherapy was 62.5 and 94.4% for those which did not (p = .014). Preserving the ovaries had no adverse effect on the recurrence of stage I disease. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Due to the rarity of the disease and the common postoperative diagnosis, only retrospective studies have been reported on low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. This disease is commonly diagnosed in premenopausal patients during the early stage. There is no consensus on preserving the ovaries, particularly in young patients, due to the tumour's hormonal characteristics and the risk of late recurrences. What do the results of this study add? Ovarian preservation had no effect on the recurrence of stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Lymphadenectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment had no effect on DFS, and adjuvant radiotherapy decreased DFS in the current study. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

PI3K-activated tumors recurred earlier than other subgroups, but had intermediate long-term outcome. Among low-grade tumors, HH and TRAF7 meningiomas exhibited elevated recurrence compared to other subgroups. Recurrence of NF2 tumors was associated with male gender, high-grade, and elevated Ki-67.

Melatonin might be able to change the pathophysiological process and prognosis into a positive way that might prevent and heal endometrial hyperplasia, which is the first stage of endometrial cancer. For this perspective, we tried to investigate the effect of melatonin on uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in an experimental rat model. Forty Wistar-Albino rats were undergone bilateral oophorectomy and randomized into four groups. To create a model of uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in all groups, except the control group [C] (n = 10), 4 mg/kg/day estradiol hemihydrate were given for 14 days. The uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia was evaluated histopathologically in the left uterine horns, then the groups were treated for 14 days as follows; melatonin (10 mg/kg/day/po) [M] (n = 10), melatonin + estradiol hemihydrate (10 mg/kg/day/po and 4 mg/kg/day/po) [M + E] (n = 10), and dark environment [D] (n = 10).

Leveraging a 3D rat primary neural organotypic in vitro model (rat brainsphere), we compare developmental neurotoxic effects of BDE-47-the most abundant PBDE congener-with four OPFR (isopropylated phenyl phosphate-IPP, triphenyl phosphate-TPHP, isodecyl diphenyl phosphate-IDDP, and tricresyl phosphate (also known as trimethyl phenyl phosphate)-TMPP). Employing mass spectroscopy-based metabolomics and transcriptomics, we observe at similar human-relevant non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.1-5 µM) stronger developmental neurotoxic effects by OPFR. This includes toxicity to neurons in the low µM range; all FR decrease the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (except BDE-47 and TPHP). Furthermore, n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), considered a neurologic diagnostic molecule, was decreased by all OPFR. At similar concentrations, the FR currently in use decreased plasma membrane dopamine active transporter expression, while BDE-47 did not. Several findings suggest astrogliosis induced by the OPFR, but not BDE-47. At the 5 µM concentrations, the OPFR more than BDE-47 interfered with myelination. An increase of cytokine gene and receptor expressions suggests that exposure to OPFR may induce an inflammatory response.

Papillary tumor of the pineal region is considered one of four pineal parenchymal tumors according to the 2007 World Health Organisation classification of central nervous system tumors. It is mostly seen in the middle age and it is rare under the age of 17 in the literature. In this report, we aim to present a case with papillary tumor of the pineal region with both CT and MRI findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis. Case report: A 17-year-old female patient who underwent a treatment of ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus 18 months ago applied to the neurosurgery clinic with nausea, vomiting, sensorineural hearing loss and Parinaud syndrome continuing through 1 month. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been applied. A 58x31x38 mm mass with cystic and mild hyperdense soft tissue components was observed in the localization of pineal gland and posterior comissure on non-enhanced CT. MRI examination revealed that the mass filled the pineal region, contained solid and large cystic components, and hyperintense on T1-weighted images. After intravenous contrast media injection, the mass enhanced more peripherally. DW-MRI showed that there is a diffusion restriction in some parts of the soft tissue components. The mass was totally resected, and pathology report revealed that it is a papillary tumor of the pineal region.

While its prognosis is generally favorable, disease recurrence is relatively frequent. Because morbidity after repeated surgery may be significant, an optimized prediction of recurrence-free survival (RFS) has the potential to improve current management strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the Ki-67 proliferation index with respect to RFS in patients with DFSP. We retrospectively analyzed data from 45 patients with DFSP. We calculated the Ki-67 proliferation index as the percentage of immunostained nuclei among the total number of tumor cell nuclei regardless of the intensity of immunostaining. We constructed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify predictors of RFS. Among the 45 patients included in the study, 8 developed local recurrences and 2 had lung metastases (median follow-up: 95.0 months; range: 5.2-412.4 months). The RFS rates at 60, 120, and 240 months of follow-up were 83.8%, 76.2%, and 65.3%, respectively. The median Ki-67 proliferation index was 14%. Notably, we identified the Ki-67 proliferation index as the only independent predictor for RFS in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio = 1.106, 95% confidence interval = 1.019-1.200, p = 0.016).

A Literature Review and Case Report.,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,"The relationship between the endocrine system and autoimmunity has been recognized for a long time and one of the best examples of autoimmune endocrine disease is autoimmune hypophysitis. A better understanding of autoimmune mechanisms and radiological, biochemical, and immunological developments have given rise to the definition of new autoimmune disorders including autoimmunity-related hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. However, whether hypothalamitis may occur as a distinct entity, is still matter of debate. Here we describe a 35-year-old woman with growing suprasellar mass, partial empty sella, central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, and hyperprolactinemia. Histopathologic examination of surgically removed suprasellar mass revealed lymphocytic infiltrate suggestive of an autoimmune disease with hypothalamic involvement. The presence of anti-hypothalamus antibodies to AVP-secreting cells (AVPcAb) at high titers and the absence of anti-pituitary antibodies suggested the diagnosis of isolated hypothalamitis. Some similar conditions have sometimes been reported in the literature but the simultaneous double finding of lymphocytic infiltrate and the presence of AVPcAb so far has never been reported. We think that the hypothalamitis can be considered a new isolated autoimmune disease affecting the hypothalamus while the lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis can be a consequence of hypothalamitis with subsequent autoimmune involvement of the pituitary. To our knowledge this is the first observation of autoimmune hypothalamic involvement with central diabetes insipidus, partial empty sella, anti-hypothalamic antibodies and hypopituitarism.",eng,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,0375362,0021-972X,aheadofprint,33104773,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,NA,NA,J Clin Endocrinol Metab

In ovarian cases, more MCs were counted overall in the necrotizing group, but there were fewer vascular structures. The increase in the number of MC and vascular structures in lungs and stomach in the non-necrotizing group supports the theory that MCs are involved in tumor progression.

INH treatment also increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activities of p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) while decreasing levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Double immunofluorescence expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in brain tissues were increased after INH administration. Furthermore, INH increased mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm), glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), NF-κB, TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GFAP in rat brain tissues. Co-treatment with CR increased anti-oxidant capacity as well as regulated inflammation and apoptosis in brain. Additionally, molecular docking results showed that CR had the potential to interact with the active sites of TNF-α and NFκ-B. In conclusion, CR improved INH-induced brain oxidative damage, inflammation and apoptosis, possibly through their antioxidant properties.",eng,Neurotoxicology,7905589,0161-813X,ppublish,33121995,10.1016/j.neuro.2020.10.009,81,NA,Neurotoxicology

Regarding these parameters, in cisplatin group NF-ƘB, MDA and TOS levels were statistically significantly increased with cisplatin administration and giving taxifolin concomitantly with cisplatin prevented this elevation. On the other hand, tGSH and TAS levels were statistically significantly decreased with cisplatin administration and routine simultaneous application of taxifolin with cisplatin prevented this decrease. In histopathological findings, haemorrhage was observed in the perineum of the injured optic nerves in the cisplatin treated group. And also edoema and degeneration in nerve fascicles in damaged optic nerves were seen in the cisplatin group. In the taxifolin treated group histopathological examinations were close to normal appearance, except mild edoema in nerve fascicles.

Investigating other specific substrates of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities may illuminate how it performs these diverse functions in mammalian cells. We report that macrophage IRE1 plays an unprecedented role in regulating phosphatidylinositide-derived signaling lipid metabolites and has profound impact on the downstream signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This cross-talk between UPR and mTOR pathways occurs through the unconventional maturation of microRNA (miR) 2137 by IRE1's RNase activity.

In addition to that, poststroke neuroregeneration is stimulated upon transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium further enhances the neuroregenerative potential of MSCs, which act by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs). The present work analyzed, whether MSC preconditioning with lithium modifies EV secretion patterns, enhancing the therapeutic potential of such derived EVs (Li-EVs) in comparison with EVs enriched from native MSCs. Indeed, Li-EVs significantly enhanced the resistance of cultured astrocytes, microglia, and neurons against hypoxic injury when compared with controls and to native EV-treated cells. Using a stroke mouse model, intravenous delivery of Li-EVs increased neurological recovery and neuroregeneration for as long as 3 months in comparison with controls and EV-treated mice, albeit the latter also showed significantly better behavioral test performance compared with controls. Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium also changed the secretion patterns for such EVs, modifying the contents of various miRNAs within these vesicles. As such, Li-EVs displayed significantly increased levels of miR-1906, which has been shown to be a new regulator of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Li-EVs reduced posthypoxic and postischemic TLR4 abundance, resulting in an inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, decreased proteasomal activity, and declined both inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, all of which culminating in reduced levels of poststroke cerebral inflammation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in termination of IL2 activation are largely unknown in human NK cells. PR/SET domain 1 was previously reported to decrease cell growth and increase apoptosis in an IL2-dependent manner in malignant NK cell lines, suggesting the possibility of down-regulation of IL2 signaling pathway gene(s) through direct transcriptional repression. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified a PRDM1 binding site on the first intron of CD25 (IL2RA), which codes for the IL2 receptor subunit regulating sensitivity to IL2 signaling, in primary NK cells activated with engineered K562 cells or IL2. Ectopic expression of PRDM1 down-regulated CD25 expression at transcript and protein levels in two PRDM1 nonexpressing NK cell lines. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD25 in two malignant NK cell lines led to progressive depletion of NK cells in low IL2 concentrations. By contrast, ectopic CD25 expression in primary human NK cells led to progressive increase in cell number in CD25-transduced cells in low IL2 concentrations. Altogether these results reveal a pivotal role of PRDM1 in inhibition of IL2-induced NK cell expansion through direct repression of CD25 in activated human NK cells. These observations provide additional support for the role of PRDM1 in attenuation of NK cell activation and growth, with implications on neoplastic transformation or NK cell function when it is deregulated.",eng,J Leukoc Biol,8405628,0741-5400,aheadofprint,33145806,10.1002/JLB.2A0520-321RR,NA,NA,J Leukoc Biol

In recent years, many studies revealed the inflammatory nature of endometriosis. Many of the immune cells and their secretory products cytokines and chemokines has been detected in body fluids of women with endometriosis. Cytokines are protein or glycoprotein in structures and hormon-like molecules that act generally in a paracrine fashion to regulate immun responses.

MSI status is assessed to detect Lynch syndrome, guide adjuvant chemotherapy, determine prognosis, and use as a companion test for checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Traditionally, MSI status is determined by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. The Idylla™ MSI Assay is a fully automated molecular method (including automated result interpretation), using seven novel MSI biomarkers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A, SULF2) and not requiring matched normal tissue. In this real-world global study, 44 clinical centers performed Idylla™ testing on a total of 1301 archived colorectal cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and compared Idylla™ results against available results from routine diagnostic testing in those sites. MSI mutations detected with the Idylla™ MSI Assay were equally distributed over the seven biomarkers, and 84.48% of the MSI-high samples had ≥ 5 mutated biomarkers, while 98.25% of the microsatellite-stable samples had zero mutated biomarkers.

Vasopressin acts primarily to reabsorb water via urinary concentration. However, fat is also a source of metabolic water, raising the possibility that vasopressin might have a role in fat accumulation. Fructose has also been reported to stimulate vasopressin. Here we tested the hypothesis that fructose induced metabolic syndrome is mediated by vasopressin. Orally administered fructose, glucose or high fructose corn syrup increased vasopressin (copeptin) concentrations and was mediated by fructokinase, an enzyme specific for fructose metabolism. Suppressing vasopressin with hydration both prevented and ameliorated fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. The vasopressin effects were mediated by the Vasopressin 1b receptor, as Vasopressin 1b receptor knockout mice were completely protected while V1a knockout paradoxically showed worse metabolic syndrome. The mechanism is likely mediated in part by de novo expression of V1b in the liver that amplifies fructokinase expression in response to fructose. Thus, our studies document a new role for vasopressin in water conservation via the accumulation of fat as a source of metabolic water. Clinically, it also suggests that increased water intake may be a beneficial way to both prevent or treat metabolic syndrome.",eng,JCI Insight,101676073,2379-3708,aheadofprint,33320834,10.1172/jci.insight.140848,NA,NA,JCI Insight

Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis.

Subsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard et al. 2015 Studies in Mycology 80: 189-245) who proposed dividing Fusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus Neocosmospora, with subsequent justification based on claims that the Geiser et al. (2013) concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic (Sandoval-Denis et al. 2018; Persoonia 41:109-129). Here we test this claim, and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as Neocosmospora were recombined in Fusarium, and nine others were renamed Fusarium. Here the global Fusarium community voices strong support for the inclusion of the FSSC in Fusarium, as it remains the best scientific, nomenclatural and practical taxonomic option available.",eng,Phytopathology,9427222,0031-949X,aheadofprint,33200960,10.1094/PHYTO-08-20-0330-LE,NA,NA,Phytopathology

Transcriptomic profiling studies have thus far revealed the presence of molecular subtypes of AML that are not accounted for by standard clinical parameters or by routinely used biomarkers. Such molecular subtypes of AML are predicted to vary in response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is an important group of proteins that play a critical role in regulating blood pressure, vascular resistance and fluid/electrolyte balance. RAS pathway genes are also known to be present locally in tissues such as the bone marrow, where they play an important role in leukemic hematopoiesis. In this study, we asked if the RAS genes could be utilized to predict drug responses in patients with AML. We show that the combined in silico analysis of up to five RAS genes can reliably predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin as well as Etoposide in AML. The same genes could also predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin when tested in vitro. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of TNF-alpha and type-I IFN response genes among sensitive, and TGF-beta and fibronectin related genes in resistant cancer cells.

For this purpose, 40 male Wistar albino rats were used. The animals were assigned to the following 4 groups: control group (received corn oil vehicle alone), diosmin-treated group (50 mg/kg bw/day orally), deltamethrin-exposed group (5 mg/kg bw/day, orally) and coadministered group (5 mg/kg bw/day deltamethrin and 50 mg/kg bw/day diosmin, orally) for 28 days. Some lipid peroxidation/antioxidant status/biochemical markers were evaluated in blood/tissue (liver, kidney, brain, heart and testis) samples and the histopathological architecture was assessed. Compared with the control group, no alteration was detected in the parameters and histological findings of the diosmin-treated group. Deltamethrin toxicity was associated with significantly increased plasma, cardiac, hepatic, renal, cerebral and testicular levels of MDA and NO, and significantly decreased GSH levels (p &lt; 0.05). Antioxidant enzyme status (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities) displayed either decrease or increase (p &lt; 0.05). Significant increase was detected in AST and ALT activities and urea and creatinine levels (p &lt; 0.05). The values of the group coadministered with deltamethrin and diosmin were similar to the values of the control group. Diosmin ameliorated deltamethrin-induced lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration and subendocardial oedema in the heart. Combined administration also minimized hepatic, renal, testicular and cerebral histopathological findings. The alterations detected in various toxicological parameters correlated well with the histopathological changes observed in various organs. In conclusion, it is suggested that diosmin could provide protection against deltamethrin-induced toxicity and organ damage in rats.",eng,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,9441769,0944-1344,aheadofprint,33242198,10.1007/s11356-020-11277-y,NA,NA,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int

Rejuveinix (RJX) is an intravenous formulation of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Its active ingredients include ascorbic acid, cyanocobalamin, thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin 5' phosphate, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and calcium D-pantothenate. RJX is being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant treatment platform for patients with sepsis, including COVID-19 patients with viral sepsis and ARDS. Here, we report its clinical safety profile in a phase 1 clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) and its potent protective activity in the lipopolysaccharide galactosamine (LPS-GalN) mouse model of ARDS. Methods: A phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-part, ascending dose-escalation study was performed in participating 76 healthy volunteer human subjects in compliance with the ICH (E6) good clinical practice guidelines to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RJX (Protocol No. RPI003; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105). The ability of RJX to prevent fatal shock, ARDS, and multi-organ failure was examined in the well-established LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Standard methods were employed for the statistical analysis of data in both studies. Findings: In the phase 1 clinical study, no participant developed serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 3-Grade 4 adverse events (AEs) or prematurely discontinued participation in the study. In the non-clinical study, RJX exhibited potent and dose-dependent protective activity, decreased the inflammatory cytokine responses (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta), and improved survival in the LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Histopathological examinations showed that RJX attenuated the LPS-GalN induced acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary edema as well as liver damage. Conclusion: RJX showed a very favorable safety profile and tolerability in human subjects.

Since oxidative stress causes pathological changes in neuronal structures antioxidant compounds gained significant attention the last decades. Although several antioxidant compounds showed neuroprotective actions in Parkinson's disease models, only a few of them demonstrated protective effects against loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons. Idebenone is an analog of the well-known antioxidant compound coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Clinical safety of idebenone is well described, and due to its high antioxidant capacity currently used to treat Freidrich's ataxia and Alzheimer's disease. Like Parkinson's disease, these diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial balance in neurons. However, knowledge about the effects of idebenone on Parkinson's disease is limited. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate and delineate the possible effects of idebenone in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease models. Idebenone (200 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the decrease of striatal expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase[quinone]-1, which is an essential element for mitochondrial respiration. Idebenone decreased the striatal levels of the lipid peroxidation products and increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx-4), which is primarily known for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, idebenone mitigated motor impairment and increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron survival. Together our results thus indicate that that idebenone has protective effects against a rotenone insult with pleiotropic actions on the cellular oxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation.",eng,Neurochem Res,7613461,0364-3190,aheadofprint,33247801,10.1007/s11064-020-03186-w,NA,NA,Neurochem Res

For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect p-value&lt; 0.05, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) assessment was used, classifying the evidence from very low to high. From 184 abstracts initially identified, 11 meta-analyses (for a total of 34 outcomes) were included. Half of the outcomes were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that stem cells are more useful than placebo. High certainty of evidence supports the associations of the use of stem cells with a better left ventricular end systolic volume and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in acute myocardial infarction; improved exercise time in refractory angina; a significant lower risk of amputation rate in critical limb ischemia; a higher successful rate in complete healing in case of lower extremities ulcer; and better values of LVEF in systolic heart failure, as compared to placebo.

Previous clinical studies on montelukast have reported conflicting results and, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies concerning these side effects had been conducted. In the current study, the effect of montelukast on depression-like behavior in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model was investigated. A total of 3 OVA challenges were applied at 2 week intervals for the persistence of asthma. Depression-like behavior was assessed using forced swim tests following each challenge and locomotor activities were evaluated using open field tests. At the end of the current study, plasma montelukast concentrations were measured and the development of asthma and effect of montelukast treatment were histopathologically examined. Inflammation scores that were increased in the OVA mice following all challenges were indicated to be reduced by montelukast treatment. The immobility time of mice increased beginning with the first challenge and this was also reduced by montelukast treatment. Montelukast administration to the control mice did not alter immobility times. Moreover, motor activity of the OVA and montelukast-treated mice were not altered. The results indicated there was no association between chronic montelukast treatment and depression. Furthermore, the chronic administration of montelukast to non-asthmatic mice did not increase immobility. However, depressive behavior increased at all time points in the OVA mice. These results indicated that chronic montelukast treatment is not associated with depression-like behavior and confirmed the association between asthma and depression.

Combined efforts from farmers, animal scientists, and veterinarians have been continuing to explore the effective disease control approaches for the production of safe animal-originated food. Implementing the immunogenomics, along with genome editing technology, has been considering as the key approach for safe food-animal production through the improvement of the host genetic resistance. Next-generation sequencing, as a cutting-edge technique, enables the production of high throughput transcriptomic and genomic profiles resulted from host-pathogen interactions. Immunogenomics combine the transcriptomic and genomic data that links to host resistance to disease, and predict the potential candidate genes and their genomic locations. Genome editing, which involves insertion, deletion, or modification of one or more genes in the DNA sequence, is advancing rapidly and may be poised to become a commercial reality faster than it has thought. The clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) [CRISPR/Cas9] system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in agricultural food production including livestock disease management. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated insertion of NRAMP1 gene for producing tuberculosis resistant cattle, and deletion of CD163 gene for producing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) resistant pigs are two groundbreaking applications of genome editing in livestock.

Treated hepatocytes with KA attenuated palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and downregulated lipogenesis-associated genes as well as ER stress markers in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, KA augmented AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) expression, and autophagy markers. The small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and ORP150, or 3-methyladenine also abrogated the effects of KA on ER stress and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In accordance with in vitro observations, KA administration to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes as well as ER stress. Moreover, KA treatment increased hepatic AMPK phosphorylation, ORP150 expression, and autophagy related markers in mouse livers. Knockdown of AMPK using in vivo transfection mitigated the effects of KA on hepatic steatosis and ER stress as well as autophagy and ORP150 expression. These results suggest that KA ameliorates hepatic steatosis via the AMPK/autophagy- and AMPK/ORP150-mediated suppression of ER stress. In sum, KA might be used as a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of NAFLD.",eng,J Cell Physiol,0050222,0021-9541,aheadofprint,33283879,10.1002/jcp.30199,NA,NA,J Cell Physiol

Numerous mutational processes leave marks on the genome in the form of mutations, copy number alterations, rearrangements or their combinations. To explore gliomagenesis, we hypothesized that gliomas with different underlying oncogenic mechanisms would have differences in the burden of various forms of these genomic alterations. This was an analysis on adult diffuse gliomas, but IDH-mutant gliomas as well as diffuse midline gliomas H3-K27M were excluded to search for the possible presence of new entities among the very heterogenous group of IDH-WT glioblastomas. The cohort was divided into two molecular subsets: (1) Molecularly-defined GBM (mGBM) as those that carried molecular features of glioblastomas (including TERT promoter mutations, 7/10 pattern, or EGFR-amplification), and (2) those who did not (others). Whole exome sequencing was performed for 37 primary tumors and matched blood samples as well as 8 recurrences. Single nucleotide variations (SNV), short insertion or deletions (indels) and copy number alterations (CNA) were quantified using 5 quantitative metrics (SNV burden, indel burden, copy number alteration frequency-wGII, chromosomal arm event ratio-CAER, copy number amplitude) as well as 4 parameters that explored underlying oncogenic mechanisms (chromothripsis, double minutes, microsatellite instability and mutational signatures). Findings were validated in the TCGA pan-glioma cohort. mGBM and &quot;Others&quot; differed significantly in their SNV (only in the TCGA cohort) and CNA metrics but not indel burden. SNV burden increased with increasing age at diagnosis and at recurrences and was driven by mismatch repair deficiency.

The neuroprotective cargo of EVs, however, has not yet been identified. To investigate such cargo and its underlying mechanism, primary neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) and cocultured with adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) or ADMSC-secreted EVs. Under such conditions, both ADMSCs and ADMSC-secreted EVs significantly reduced neuronal death. Screening for signalling cascades being involved in the interaction between ADMSCs and neurons revealed a decreased autophagic flux as well as a declined p53-BNIP3 activity in neurons receiving either treatment paradigm. However, the aforementioned effects were reversed when ADMSCs were pretreated with the inhibitor of exosomal secretion GW4869 or when Hrs was knocked down. In light of miR-25-3p being the most highly expressed miRNA in ADMSC-EVs interacting with the p53 pathway, further in vitro work focused on this pathway. Indeed, a miR-25-3p oligonucleotide mimic reduced cell death, whereas the anti-oligonucleotide increased autophagic flux and cell death by modulating p53-BNIP3 signalling in primary neurons exposed to OGD. Likewise, native ADMSC-EVs but not EVs obtained from ADMSCs pretreated with the anti-miR-25-3p oligonucleotide (ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p) confirmed the aforementioned in vitro observations in C57BL/6 mice exposed to cerebral ischemia. The infarct size was reduced, and neurological recovery was increased in mice treated with native ADMSC-EVs when compared to ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p. ADMSCs induce neuroprotection by improved autophagic flux through secreted EVs containing miR-25-3p. Hence, our work uncovers a novel key factor in naturally secreted ADMSC-EVs for the regulation of autophagy and induction of neuroprotection in a preclinical stroke model.",eng,J Extracell Vesicles,101610479,2001-3078,ppublish,33304476,10.1002/jev2.12024,10,1,J Extracell Vesicles

Most of the studies investigating PD-L1 expression in endometrial carcinoma have used tissue microarrays and did not examine all tumor blocks. In this study, we analyzed the expression of PD-L1 in resection specimens of 176 consecutive endometrial carcinomas using all tumor blocks; we compared PD-L1 expression in MMR-deficient endometrial carcinomas, including the MLH1 and PMS2-loss subgroup, and the other MMR-loss subgroups (MSH2 and MSH6, isolated PMS2, and isolated MSH6), with the MMR-intact subgroup. MLH1 methylation was performed in tumors with MLH1 and PMS2 loss. Tumor cell (TC) and tumor-associated immune cell (IC) PD-L1 positivity with a 1% cutoff was observed in 21% (n=37) and 66.5% (n=117) of cases, respectively, and with a 5% cutoff in 5.1% (n=9) and 39.8% (n=70) of cases, respectively. MMR protein deficiency was a statistically significant parameter associated with IC PD-L1 positivity, with 1% and 5% cutoffs on multivariate analysis [odds ratio (OR)=5.236, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.075-13.211, P=0.001, and OR=3.702, 95% CI=1.759-7.791, P=0.001, respectively].

Analysis revealed that genes associated with cancer stem cells, such as POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG, BMI1, BMP2, CD44, SOX9, and ALDH1 were markedly upregulated in enzalutamide resistant cells. Amongst the pathways enriched in the enzalutamide-resistant cells were those associated with RUNX2, hedgehog, integrin signaling, and molecules associated with elastic fibers. Further examination of a patient cohort undergoing ADT and its comparison with no-ADT group demonstrated high expression of POU5F1 (OCT4), ALDH1, and SOX2 in ADT specimens, suggesting that they may be clinically relevant therapeutic targets. Altogether, our approach exhibits the potential of integrative transcriptomic analyses to identify critical genes and pathways of antiandrogen resistance as a promising approach for designing novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent drug resistance.",eng,Int J Mol Sci,101092791,1422-0067,epublish,33339129,10.3390/ijms21249568,21,24,Int J Mol Sci

The prevalence of CE depends upon human behavioral risk factors, the diversity and ecology of animal host interactions and the genetic diversity within Echinococcus species which differ in their zoonotic potential and pathogenicity. It is a neglected, economic and socio-cultural problem in Pakistan. The available data about the incidence of CE is very limited and no extensive study has been reported in Pakistan.

All children had normal growth and no sign of chondrodysplasia at birth and prior to their primary disease. After HSCT, all children developed growth failure, with standard deviation scores for height at or below -3. Radiographically, all children had changes in the spine, metaphyses and epiphyses, compatible with a spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. Genomic sequencing failed to detect pathogenic variants in genes associated with osteochondrodysplasias.

In this way, 30 min after rats were given 25 and 50 mg/kg/b.w CHR orally for seven consecutive days, 30 mg/kg/b.w PbAc was administered orally. In biochemical analysis of testicular tissue, it was found that PbAc-reduced antioxidant parameters [glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)], while it increased lipid peroxidation, inflammatory markers [nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)], and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In the immunohistochemical examination, it was determined that PbAc increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3. Accordingly, PbAc was found to cause a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in the percentage of dead sperm. However, it has been observed that CHR relieves oxidative stress due to its antioxidant properties, thus protecting against inflammation and apoptosis. It also allowed the CHR sperm parameters to return to control group levels. The results revealed that CHR could be a natural substance to be used in Pb-induced testicular toxicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lead (Pb) is an important environmental contaminant heavy metal. Pb is believed to reduce fertility in men. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the damage caused by Pb to testicular tissue. CHR is an antioxidant substance that occurs naturally in various plants and has various pharmacological properties. In the present study, it was investigated whether CHR has a protective effect against testicular toxicity induced by PbAc. The results revealed that in rats, CHR protects the testicular tissue from PbAc toxicity by showing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, thus bringing sperm parameters closer to normal.",eng,J Food Biochem,7706045,0145-8884,aheadofprint,33368351,10.1111/jfbc.13593,NA,NA,J Food Biochem

Survival analyses were performed in a novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable mouse model of PCa under adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine+/-physostigmine/pyridostigmine (n = 30 mice).

Inhibition of this cancer-cell-intrinsic AChE via pyridostigmine and physostigmine, or administration of acetylcholine (ACh), diminished PCa cell viability and invasion in vitro and in vivo via suppression of pERK signaling, and reduced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable PCa mouse model, adjuvant co-therapy with AChE blockers had no impact on survival. Accordingly, survival of resected PCa patients did not differ based on tumor AChE expression levels.

In recent years, nuclear imaging methods have gained importance in the diagnosis of IE. The present study aims to investigate the imaging potential of 99mTc-labeled vancomycin ( 99mTc-Vancomycin) as a new agent that would enable the diagnosis of IE in its early stages when it is difficult to diagnose or has small vegetation, in the experimental rat model.

Patient-related factors determining the outcome in SM are largely unknown. Methods: We examined the impact of sex on the clinical features, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in 3403 patients with mastocytosis collected in the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM). The impact of cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations on sex differences was analyzed in a subset of patients. Results: Of all patients enrolled, 55.3% were females. However, a male predominance was found in a subset of advanced SM (AdvSM) patients, namely SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN, 70%; p &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, organomegaly (male: 23% vs. female: 13%, p = 0.007) was more, whereas skin involvement (male: 71% vs. female: 86%, p = 0.001) was less frequent in males. In all patients together, OS (p &lt; 0.0001) was significantly inferior in males, and also within the WHO sub-categories indolent SM, aggressive SM (ASM) and SM-AHN. PFS was significantly (p = 0.0002) worse in males when all patients were grouped together; due to low numbers of events, this significance persisted only in the subcategory smoldering SM.

Somatostatin analogue (SSA)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) have been used in clinical trials and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Focus 3 performed a multidisciplinary Delphi process to deliver a balanced perspective on molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). NETs form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones. These cells, called neuroendocrine cells, can be found throughout the body, but NETs are most often found in the abdomen, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. These tumours may also be found in the lungs, pancreas and adrenal glands. In addition to being rare, NETs are also complex and may be difficult to diagnose. Most NETs are non-functioning; however, a minority present with symptoms related to hypersecretion of bioactive compounds. NETs often do not cause symptoms early in the disease process. When diagnosed, substantial number of patients are already found to have metastatic disease. Several societies' guidelines address Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) management; however, many issues are still debated, due to both the difficulty in acquiring strong clinical evidence in a rare and heterogeneous disease and the different availability of diagnostic and therapeutic options across countries. EANM Focus 3 reached consensus on employing 68gallium-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA)-based PET/CT with diagnostic CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for unknown primary NET detection, metastatic NET, NET staging/restaging, suspected extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and suspected paraganglioma. Consensus was reached on employing 18fluorine-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/CT in neuroendocrine carcinoma, G3 NET and in G1-2 NET with mismatched lesions (CT-positive/[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA-negative). Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was recommended for second line treatment for gastrointestinal NET with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA uptake in all lesions, in G1/G2 NET at disease progression, and in a subset of G3 NET provided all lesions are positive at [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA.

Some PTCs with classical papillae can be totally or partially encapsulated, and these tumors are called &quot;encapsulated&quot; (conventional) variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of this variant, comparing with non-encapsulated conventional type PTC. Among 823 thyroidectomy specimens with PTC diagnosed between 2015 and 2018, 121 tumors from 105 patients (12.75%) were reclassified as encapsulated conventional PTC. In 76 patients, tumors were unifocal. Size, cystic changes, background thyroiditis, psammoma bodies, cervical lymph node metastasis at presentation, capsular/vascular invasion, and immunohistochemical BRAF-V600E expression were evaluated. Ninety-two non-encapsulated conventional PTCs served as control group. Encapsulated cases were predominantly women (73.3%), 56.4% were microcarcinomas, 97.5% had cystic changes, 81.4% were BRAF-V600E positive, and 36.8% of unifocal encapsulated tumors had cervical lymph node metastasis. Thyroiditis and psammoma bodies were detected in nearly half of the encapsulated PTCs. Fourteen percent of the unifocal tumors showed total encapsulation, whereas capsular and vascular invasion was detected in 85.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Encapsulated cases did not show any significant difference from the control group, except for prominent cystic changes (p &lt; 0.001). Relationship between lymph node metastasis at presentation and capsular invasion was statistically significant (p = 0.001), and metastasis was more frequent in cases with extensive capsular invasion (no/minimal invasion versus extensive invasion, p &lt; 0.001). Cystic changes are very common, and this feature deserves mentioning as a morphological characteristic of encapsulated conventional PTCs.

The hypoxic condition is a consequence of an imbalance between rapidly proliferating cells and a vascularization that leads to lower oxygen levels in tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an essential transcription factor contributing to the regulation of hypoxia-associated genes. Some of these genes modulate molecular cascades associated with the Warburg effect and its accompanying pathways and, therefore, represent promising targets for cancer treatment. Current progress in the development of therapeutic approaches brings several promising inhibitors of HIF-1. Flavonoids, widely occurring in various plants, exert a broad spectrum of beneficial effects on human health, and are potentially powerful therapeutic tools against cancer. Recent evidences identified numerous natural flavonoids and their derivatives as inhibitors of HIF-1, associated with the regulation of critical glycolytic components in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase II (HKII), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we discuss the results of most recent studies evaluating the impact of flavonoids on HIF-1 accompanied by the regulation of critical enzymes contributing to the Warburg phenotype.

Recently, studies have demonstrated substantial variation between countries in terms of their approach to sampling gallbladders, and furthermore, that pathologists from different continents apply highly variable criteria in determining stage of invasion in this organ. These findings raised the question of whether these variations in pathologic evaluation could account for the vastly different survival rates of T2 GBC reported in the literature. In this study, survival of 316 GBCs from three countries (Chile n = 137, South Korea n = 105, USA n = 74), all adequately sampled (with a minimum of five tumor sections examined) and histopathologically verified as pT2 (after consensus examination by expert pathologists from three continents), was analyzed. Chilean patients had a significantly worse prognosis based on 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.83, p = 0.002) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.51-3.84, p &lt; 0.001), compared to their South Korean counterparts, even when controlled for age and sex. Comparing the USA to South Korea, the survival differences in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75, p = 0.015) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.14-3.31, p = 0.015) were also pronounced.

In conclusion, the survival of true T2 GBC in properly classified cases is neither as good nor as bad as previously documented in the literature and shows notable geographic differences even in well-sampled cases with consensus histopathologic criteria.

Label=""CASE"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 10-year-old boy who was followed with the diagnosis of Katagener`s syndrome, presented with a progressive mass in the cervical region for 6 months. Physical examination revealed mental retardation, multiple lymphadenopathies, the largest in the left cervical region (4x4 cm), and pectus carinatum. Also, on cardiovascular examination, apex beat was felt on the right fifth intercostal space along midclavicular line. Magnetic resonance imaging of nasopharynx showed narrowing of the nasopharyngeal airway with an increase in wall thickness up to 2.5 cm on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Also, bilateral multiple cervical lymphadenopathies were noted. The pathological examination of the biopsy from cervical lymphadenopathy revealed a diagnosis of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Chemotherapy was started for nasopharyngeal carcinoma chemotherapy regimen including cisplatin, docetaxel, and 5-fluorouracil. After four cycles of chemotherapy there was a significant regression in nasopharyngeal mass and lymphadenopathies. The patient underwent radiotherapy to the nasopharynx and bilaterally cervical regions. The patient has been in follow-up for 6 years well and tumor free. However, he is still under the supervision of the pediatric immunology and allergy departments due to recurrent respiratory infections and sinusitis.

Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19.

33656364,2021,3,0191-2917,Plant disease,First Report of Fusarium culmorum and Microdochium bolleyi Causing Root Rot on Triticale in Kazakhstan.,10.1094/PDIS-12-20-2659-PDN,"Triticale (×Triticosecale Wittmack) is obtained from wheat × rye crossing. It is positioned between wheat and rye in terms of resistance to soilborne pathogens including Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Fusarium culmorum, F. avenaceum, and Bipolaris sorokiniana (Arseniuk and Góral 2015). In 2019, seven triticale fields were surveyed in Almaty Province, Kazakhstan to examine soil-borne fungal pathogens. A total of 28 symptomatic plants with stunting, rot or discolored root were collected to identify causal agents. The overall disease incidence was approximately 8 to 10% in the fields. Fungi were isolated from 3-5 mm pieces excised from symptomatic tissues. The pieces were exposed to surface disinfection in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, blotted dry, and plated on 1/5 strength potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 0.01% streptomycin. Plates were left in the dark at 23°C for 7 days. A total of 34 fungal colonies were isolated of which nineteen isolates, originally from six fields showed the cultural characteristics of B. sorokiniana. This species was previously reported to cause common root rot on triticale in Kazakhstan (Özer et al. 2020). Ten isolates from four fields produced pale orange and cottony mycelium with red pigmentation on the agar, which is typical of Fusarium-like growth. The remaining isolates (n=5) from two fields produced salmon-colored and scarce aerial mycelium with no soluble pigmentation, similar to Microdochium spp. Fusarium isolates produced thick-walled and curved macroconidia with 3-4 septa (n=50, 25.7 to 37.6 × 4.1 to 7.3 μm in size) and notched basal cell on PDA, but microconidia were absent, which matches the description of F. culmorum (Wm.G. Sm.) Sacc. (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Microdochium isolates produced swollen, brown, and thick-walled chlamydospores and hyaline, one-celled, and thin-walled conidia (n=50, 5.4 to 9.3 × 1.5 to 3.0 μm in size) formed on ampullate and cylindrical conidiogenous cells on oatmeal agar (OA). These morphological features are consistent with previous observations for Microdochium bolleyi (R. Sprague) de Hoog &amp; Herm.-Nijh. (Hong et al. 2008). To confirm morphological preliminary identifications, the portion of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) gene was amplified with EF1/EF2 primers (O'Donnell et al. 1998) for representative Fusarium isolates (n=4) for each field. Additionally, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA was amplified with ITS1/ITS4 primers (White et al. 1990) for representative Microdochium isolates (n=2) for each field. BLASTn queries against NCBI GenBank revealed that the EF1-α sequences of Fusarium isolates (MW311081-MW311084) shared 100% identity with F. culmorum strain CBS 110262 (KT008433). The ITS sequences of M. bolleyi isolates (MW301448-MW301449) matched that of M. bolleyi strain CBS 137.64 (AM502264) with 100% sequence similarity. Pathogenicity test was conducted on pregerminated seeds of triticale cv. Balausa. A plastic pot (17 cm height, 9 cm in diam) was filled with a sterile mixture of vermiculite, peat, and soil (1:1:1, v/v/v). Mycelial plugs (1 cm in diam) were cut from the margin of a growing culture of representative isolates (Kaz_Fus123 and Kaz_Mb01) and placed onto the mixture in the pot. A sterile agar plug was employed as a control treatment. One pregerminated seed was put on the plug and covered with the mixture. The pots were transferred to a growth chamber set at 23 ± 2°C and a photoperiod of 14 hours. The experiment was performed twice using 5 replication pots per isolate. Four weeks after inoculation, discoloration of the crown was observed on all the inoculated roots, whereas no symptoms were observed on the control plants. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reisolating and identifying the pathogen based on the morphology described above. This is the first report of M. bolleyi and F. culmorum causing root rot on triticale in Kazakhstan. Although B. sorokiniana is the most primary pathogen that may limit yield in the production of triticale in Kazakhstan, F. culmorum and M. bolleyi have been found to be less frequent and less aggressive pathogens, respectively. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential distribution and impact of these pathogens on triticale.",eng,Plant Dis,9882809,0191-2917,aheadofprint,33656364,10.1094/PDIS-12-20-2659-PDN,NA,NA,Plant Dis

Although several hypotheses have been suggested, the etiopathogenesis of SANT remains unknown. It is also unclear whether SANT is a reactive or a neoplastic lesion. Since CTNNB1 (β-catenin gene) exon 3 mutations were frequently detected in some rare fibrovascular lesions, we aimed to investigate the presence of oncogenic CTNNB1 mutations in SANT cases. For this purpose, 7 cases of SANT with typical histopathological features were retrieved. First, the presence of CTNNB1 exon 3 alterations was examined with a recently described immunohistochemistry-based method. Then, the findings were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and Sanger sequencing. In all cases, immunochemistry of β-catenin gave a staining pattern that was suggestive of exon 3 alteration; however, no missense mutations were found in any case at the CTNNB1 exon 3 hotspot region. Subsequently, we screened for large interstitial deletions of CTNNB1 exon 3 which revealed short PCR products in three cases. Sequencing confirmed that these cases had large interstitial deletions, resulting in loss of the entire exon 3 of CTNNB1. In the remaining four cases, loss of exon 3 was documented at the cDNA level, although genomic deletion was not identified. These results demonstrate that loss of CTNNB1 exon 3 and stabilization of β-catenin with activation of Wnt signaling pathway might have a significant role in the pathogenesis of SANT.

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has been known to be a risk factor for the development of more severe form of saphenous vein graft disease after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We aimed to evaluate the impact of type II-DM on histopathological features of great saphenous vein grafts of patients undergoing CABG PATIENTS AND METHODS: . Forty consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG were enrolled into the study. Patients were grouped into two; Diabetic group (n=20); includes patients with preoperative diagnosis of type II-DM and Non-diabetic group (n=20): those without type II-DM. In all patients, a short segment of the great saphenous vein graft at the level of medial malleolus was taken for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evaluation. Moreover, immunoexpressions of Caveolin-1, Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were studied RESULTS: . There were no differences in the demographics of patients between two groups. The magnitude of intimal fibrosis in diabetic group was slightly higher than in non-diabetics (1.95±0.99 versus 1.3±0.8, p=0.04). In TEM, vacuolization in endothelial cells, substance accumulation along with coarse collagen fibers and cytoplasmic degeneration with vacuolization in muscle cells were detected in diabetic group. While there were no differences in Caveolin-1 and VCAM-1 immunostaining, the intensity of positive eNOS immunostaining was significantly higher in endothelium (2.10±0.64 versus 1.55±0.68, p=0.01) and tunica media 1.75±0.63 versus 1.2±0.52, p= 0.007) in non-diabetic group, respectively) compared with diabetic group CONCLUSION: . Type II DM might be a reason for decreased expression of eNOS and increased intimal fibrosis, vacuolization of endothelial and smooth muscle cells in saphenous vein grafts.

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",eng,Autophagy,101265188,1554-8627,aheadofprint,33634751,10.1080/15548627.2020.1797280,NA,NA,Autophagy

A significant proportion of cases presents as clinically and grossly inapparent lesions, and grossing protocols are not well established. Among epithelial alterations, pseudo-pyloric gland metaplasia is ubiquitous and of no apparent consequence, whereas goblet cell metaplasia and a foveolar change in surface cells require closer attention. Low-grade dysplasia is difficult to objectively define and appears to be clinically inconsequential by itself; however, extra sampling is required to exclude the possibility of accompanying more significant lesions. For high-grade dysplasia (&quot;high-grade BilIN&quot; a.k.a. &quot;carcinoma in-situ&quot;), a complete sampling is necessary to rule out invasion. Designating in-situ or minimally invasive carcinomas limited to muscularis or above as early gallbladder carcinoma (EGBC) helps alleviate the major geographic differences (West/East) in the criteria for &quot;invasiveness&quot; to assign a case to pTis or pT1. Total sampling is crucial in proper diagnosis of such cases. A subset of invasive GBCs (5-10%) arise from the intracholecystic neoplasm (ICN, &quot;adenoma-carcinoma sequence&quot;) category. About 2/3rds of ICNs have invasive carcinoma. However, this propensity differ by subtype.

Further, BCX supplementation modulated inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, and NF-κB), apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3), growth proteins and factors (GAP43, VEGF), glial and neuronal proteins (GFAP, NCAM), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), along with the mitochondrial stress markers (ATF4, ATF6, Grp78, Grp94) in the rat retinal tissue. This study indicates that oral supplementation of BCX exerts a protective effect on light-induced retinal damage in the rats via reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, also protected against mitochondrial DNA damage and cellular death.",eng,Oxid Med Cell Longev,101479826,1942-0994,epublish,33628377,10.1155/2021/6672525,2021,NA,Oxid Med Cell Longev

When the tourniquet is released, reperfusion injury occurs with the resumption of blood flow. Molecular hydrogen can easily attach to biomembranes and enter cytosol, mitochondria and other organelles of the cell and convert the formed OH- to H₂O to prevent cell and tissue damage.                 Label=""AIM"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":We investigated the effects of hydrogen rich saline solution (HRSS) on penile Mathieu type flap tissue with Pt application in rats.                 Label=""STUDY DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Thirty-six Wistar-albino male rats were randomly divided into six groups. No operations were performed in the Sham group. Ventral penile Mathieu type flap was prepared and Pt was applied to the root of the penis with a plastic band in other groups. Pt was applied 10 and 30 min in the PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. HRSS was injected intraperitoneally (ip) 5 ml/kg just before Pt was released in the HRSS1⁰ and HRSS³⁰ groups. In the HRSSB group, HRSS was injected 1 h before 10 min of Pt application. At the 4th hour of experiments the rats were sacrificed and tissue samples were taken for biochemical and histopathological studies. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were determined in the penile tissue. The results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Pearson's Chi-Squared test.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Tissue MDA, MPO, IL-6 and TNF-α values were significantly lower in all HRSS groups compared to PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. Tissue GSH levels of HRSS groups were higher compared to PT groups. Histopathologically, inflammation was found to be higher in PT groups compared to HRSS groups. Interestingly, in the HRSSB group with HRSS administration prior to Pt, the damage was less in grade, but not statistically different than the other HRSS groups (p &gt; 0.05).

A new overlap syndrome between IgG4-RD and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) has recently been described in the adult population. Here we present a 16-year-old adolescent girl admitted with abdominal pain, episcleritis, palpable purpura, salivary gland enlargement, and bloody diarrhea. Laboratory investigations revealed findings of glomerulonephritis. Abdominal imaging surprisingly revealed a focal mass in the pancreatic tail, while the c-ANCA level was found to be quite high as well as serum IgG4 level. Biopsy of the pancreatic mass showed lymphoplasmacytic IgG4 positive cells infiltrating the pancreas with storiform fibrosis compatible with IgG4-related AIP. The renal biopsy that was done simultaneously showed necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis indicating AAV. Renal biopsy showed IgG4 positive plasma cells very rarely by immunohistochemical examination, which does not indicate any significance for IgG4-RD.

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We have analyzed in detail the cellular components and staining intensities of 46 adenomas all of which contained parathyroid rims, 12 hyperplasia and 5 adjacent non-neoplastic thyroidectomy materials (63 patients, 114 tissues).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":While no staining was identified in the thyroid tissue, cytoplasmic PTH immunoreactivity was observed in all (100%) normal parathyroid tissues, rim of PGs and hyperplasia, and in 43/46 cases (93.4%) of adenomas. Adenoma and hyperplasia were less stained than normal PG (p &lt; 0.05). We detected GATA3 staining in all cases except for the thyroid (100%). Weak positivity (1+) was most apparent in adenoma cases (p &lt; 0.05). Monoclonal PAX-8 immunoreactivity was not identified in any normal parathyroid tissue and rim of PG but positive immunoreactivity was detected in 83.3% of hyperplasia cases (10/12), 84.8% of adenoma (39/46) and 100% of thyroid tissues (5/5) (p &lt; 0.05). However, polyclonal PAX-8 immunoreactivity was detected in one normal parathyroid tissue (1/5) and seven (7/46) rim of PGs.

The aim of this study was to scrutinize the utility of three immunohistochemical markers including Forkhead box protein 2 (FOXL2), SOX9, and β-catenin and DICER1 mutation status in distinguishing SCTATs from other ovarian SCSTs. Nine cases of SCTAT, 10 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SCLT), 10 adult-type granulosa cell tumor (AGCT), and 8 juvenile-type granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) were included in the study. SCTATs were characterized by diffuse and strong expression of SOX9, focal and weak expression of FOXL2, and the absence of DICER1 mutation. However, AGCTs and JGCTs displayed strong and diffuse expression of FOXL2, focal/no immunoreaction for SOX9. SLCTs generally showed moderate intensity of FOXL2 and SOX9 expression. Nuclear β-catenin expression was observed in none of SLCT, 1/9 of SCTAT, 6/8 JGCT, and 4/10 AGCT cases, respectively. DICER1 hotspot mutation was detected in only 3 cases of SLCT and 2 cases of JGCT. We conclude that in addition to strong and diffuse SOX9 expression, weak/absent expression of FOXL2 is suggestive for the diagnosis of SCTAT. Hence, we suggest that inclusion of these two markers, SOX-9 and FOXL2, to the immunohistochemical panel helps in differentiation of SCTAT from other SCSTs in addition to morphologic findings. We also conclude that SCTATs of the ovary do not harbor DICER1 hotspot mutation.",eng,Virchows Arch,9423843,0945-6317,aheadofprint,33566167,10.1007/s00428-021-03052-2,NA,NA,Virchows Arch

This retrospective case-control study has been conducted on a cohort of patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy between 2015 and 2017 due to complex injury treatment. The outcomes were assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES), the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Score, need for non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumption and the visual analog scale (VAS). Complications and changes in smoking status were also noted. A cohort of 59 patients underwent shoulder arthroscopy, due to complex LHBT pathology and RCTs, and were enrolled in the final follow-up examination; with mean duration of 26.03 months. According to smoking status, 27 of patients were classified as smokers, and the remaining 32 were non-smokers. In the examined cohort, 36 patients underwent the LHBT tenotomy and 23 tenodesis. We observed a relationship between smoking status and distribution of various RCTs (p &lt; 0.0001). The mean postoperative ASES and UCLA scores were 80.81 and 30.18 in the smoker's group and 84.06 and 30.93 in the non-smoker's group, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in pre/postoperative ASES and postoperative UCLA scores between smokers and non-smokers (p &gt; 0.05). The VAS was significantly lower in the non-smokers' group (p = 0.0021). Multi-tendon injuries of the shoulder are a serious challenge for surgeons, and to obtain an excellent functional outcome, we need to limit the negative risk factors, including smoking. Furthermore, there is a significant association between smoking and the occurrence of massive rotator cuff tears, and the pain level measured by the VAS. Simultaneous surgical treatment of RC and LHBT lesions in the smoker population allowed us to obtain the functional outcomes approximated to non-smokers in the long-term follow-up. Of course, we cannot assert that smoking is the real cause of all complications, however, we may assume that this is a very important, negative factor in shoulder arthroscopy.",eng,J Clin Med,101606588,2077-0383,epublish,33562734,10.3390/jcm10040599,10,4,J Clin Med

Angiogenesis is important for mesothelioma progression, but so far, anti-angiogenic agents have not improved patient survival. Our hypothesis is that better understanding of the regulation of angiogenesis in this tumor would largely improve the success of such a therapy. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that acts as a co-receptor in various cellular processes including angiogenesis. In MM, the expression of SDC-1 is generally low but when present, SDC-1 associates to epithelioid differentiation, inhibition of tumor cell migration and favorable prognosis, meanwhile SDC-1 decrease deteriorates the prognosis. In the present study, we studied the effect of SDC-1 overexpression and silencing on MM cells ability to secrete angiogenic factors and monitored the downstream effect of SDC-1 modulation on endothelial cells proliferation, wound healing, and tube formation. This was done by adding conditioned medium from SDC-1 transfected and SDC-1 silenced mesothelioma cells to endothelial cells. Moreover, we investigated the interplay and molecular functional changes in angiogenesis in a co-culture system and characterized the soluble angiogenesis-related factors secreted to the conditioned media. We demonstrated that SDC-1 over-expression inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, and tube formation of endothelial cells. This effect was mediated by a multitude of angiogenic factors comprising angiopoietin-1 (Fold change ± SD: 0.65 ± 0.07), FGF-4 (1.45 ± 0.04), HGF (1.33 ± 0.07), NRG1-β1 (1.35 ± 0.08), TSP-1 (0.8 ± 0.02), TIMP-1 (0.89 ± 0.01) and TGF-β1 (1.35 ± 0.01). SDC-1 silencing increased IL8 (1.33 ± 0.06), promoted wound closure, but did not influence the tube formation of endothelial cells. Pleural effusions from mesothelioma patients showed that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels correlate to soluble SDC-1 levels and have prognostic value. In conclusion, SDC-1 over-expression affects the angiogenic factor secretion of mesothelioma cells and thereby inhibits endothelial cells proliferation, tube formation, and wound healing. VEGF could be used in prognostic evaluation of mesothelioma patients together with SDC-1.",eng,Cancers (Basel),101526829,2072-6694,epublish,33562126,10.3390/cancers13040655,13,4,Cancers (Basel)

When over 3800 isolates were examined, three major population clusters were revealed: North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, with distinct subclusters in the highly diverse Eastern European cluster. Modeling of historical scenarios using approximate Bayesian computation revealed the North American cluster was derived from an ancestral population in Eurasia. The Northeastern European subcluster was shown to be ancestral to all other European clusters and subclusters. The Turkish subcluster diverged first, followed by the Central European subcluster, then the Western European cluster, which has subsequently spread to much of the Southern Hemisphere. All clusters and subclusters contained both mating-types of the fungus, indicating the potential for sexual reproduction, although asexual reproduction remained the primary mode of reproduction.

Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GH and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10 min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40 min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs.

The 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% break-apart ratios were determined as a threshold value, and each of these was evaluated separately. Based on the results of these analyses, we detected the optimal threshold value and also performed further investigations.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 70 patients were enrolled in the study. The most significant decrease in the risk of the progression or death was detected at the 50% threshold value and it was accepted as the optimal threshold. The median PFS was 17.9 vs. 7.06 months (mo) in the pts with high ALK rearrangement than low (HR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.76, p 0.004). The median OS was also significant longer in high ALK rearrange group (44.6 mo vs. 16.8 mo; HR: 0.37, 95% Cl 0.1883-0.7315; p 0.004). The intracranial progression during crizotinib treatment was significantly frequent in the pts with high ALK rearrangement (62.5-32.5%, P 0.039) DISCUSSION: In this study, we found that the high break-apart ratio can predict the extent of benefit from targeted therapy in ALK-positive NSCLC patients. Based on the results of this study, the percentage of the ALK rearrangement can be used to predict treatment outcome and to choose the optimal targeted agent in the treatment of metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC.",eng,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,7902060,0171-5216,aheadofprint,33528638,10.1007/s00432-021-03546-1,NA,NA,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol

We aimed to examine liver/kidney functions, neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity, sphingolipid levels, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression in rats under ER stress. ER stress was induced by tunicamycin (TM) and the ER stress inhibitor taurodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) was injected before induction of ER stress. ER stress was confirmed by increased tissue levels of GRP78. Hematological and biochemical profiles were measured by autoanalyzers while hepatic and renal injury was evaluated via microscopy and histopathological scoring. Tissue levels of C16-C24 sphingomyelins (SM), C16-C24 ceramides (CERs) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) were determined by LC-MS/MS. Tissue cPLA2 and COX-2 were measured by western blot and activity assays. Tunicamycin treatment caused kidney and liver function test abnormalities, increased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels but decreased white blood cell counts. Histopathological findings showed hepatic necroinflammation and renal tubular damage in rats treated with TM. TUDCA administration attenuated WBC abnormalities and TM- induced hepatic/renal functional impairment in ER stress, as evident by significantly restored serum ALT, AST, creatinine, and total bilirubin levels. A significant increase was observed in N-SMase activity, tissue levels of C16-C24 CERs, cPLA2 and COX-2 expression in liver and kidney tissue under ER stress. TUDCA administration decreased tissue CER levels, cPLA2 and COX-2 expression as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation.

Mice were treated with Indo (5 or 30 mg/kg, p.o) alone or in combination with ALA (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg, i.p). in vivo anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by formalin-induced paw edema measured as paw thickness and edema. Gastric damage was evaluated macroscopically and histologically by scoring mucosal hemorrhage, erosion, edema and inflammation. To our results, Indo was ineffective at 5 mg/kg, but co-treatment with Indo and ALA significantly reduced paw edema, implying that ALA augmented the anti-inflammatory effect of subtherapeutic dose of Indo. However, ALA was not able to induce a further increase in the anti-inflammatory effect of Indo at 30 mg/kg. Unlike the treatment with Indo at 5 mg/kg, Indo at 30 mg/kg caused severe gastric damage that prevented by co-treatment with ALA.

As a clinically defined entity, its pathologic correlates are poorly characterized. Eighty-four resected CCs from the West were reanalyzed. After applying established Japanese criteria, 9/66 with available imaging were disqualified and 10/39 with preoperative cyst typing had to be recategorized. None had been diagnosed with, or evaluated for, pancreatobiliary maljunction, but on retrospective analysis of radiologic images, 12/66 were found to have pancreatobiliary maljunction. The clinical findings were: F/M=5.7; mean age, 48; most (77%) presented with abdominal pain; mean size, 2.9 cm; choledocholithiasis 11%. Gross/histologic examination revealed 3 distinct pathology-based categories: (I) Cystic dilatation of native ducts (81%). (II) Double bile duct (13%), almost all of which were found in women (10/11); all were diagnosed by pathologic examination, and not preoperative diagnosis. (III) Gastrointestinal (GI) duplication type (6%). Microscopic findings of the entire cohort included mucosal-predominant lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (50%), follicular cholangitis (7%), mucosal hyperplasia (43%; 13% with papillae), intestinal metaplasia (10%), BilIN-like hyperplasia (17%), erosion/ulceration (13%), and severe dysplasia-mimicking atypia including &quot;detachment atypia&quot; and micropapillary degeneration (11%). Carcinomatous changes were seen in 14 cases (17%) (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ in 7, intraductal papillary neoplasm 1, and invasive carcinoma 6); and 13/14 of these occurred in pathologic category I, all with cyst size &gt;1 cm. In conclusion, diagnostic imaging guidelines used in Asia are not routinely used (but should be adopted) in the West. Pathologically, cases designated as CC are classifiable in 3 groups: category 1 (dilated native duct type), more prone to carcinomatous change; category 2, double-duct phenomenon (all but 1 being female in this study); and category 3, GI-type duplication. Overall, 17% of CCs show carcinomatous change (50% of them invasive).

Protein products of transcripts were shown and detected by western blot and mass spectrometry analysis. We focused on different transcripts of PKM and investigated the associations between their mRNA expression and the clinical survival of the patients in 25 different cancers.

One of the reasons for the failure of BC treatment is reportedly the ineffectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs). HER2 receptors have an important role in the self-renewal of BCSCs. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cytokine levels were found to be higher in BCSCs, which demonstrates their potential metastatic capacity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of BCSCs to trastuzumab and to investigate the MMP levels in primary breast cancer cells and HER2+ BCSCs. Tumour tissue samples were obtained during surgical intervention from ten breast cancer patients, and primary culture cells were established from these tissues. Four major molecular subgroups were sorted from the primary culture: HER2+ BCSCs (CD44+CD24-HER2+), HER2- BCSCs (CD44+CD24-HER2-), HER2- primary culture cells (CD44+CD24+HER2-) and triple positive primary culture cells (CD44+CD24+HER2+). These cells were cultured and treated with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and the combination of those three drugs for 96 h. Cellular responses to these drugs were determined by XTT cytotoxicity test. MMPs and cytokine array analysis showed that MMPs and TIMP-1, TIMP-2 proteins were expressed more in HER2+ BCSCs than in primary culture. HER2- BCSCs were more resistant to drugs than HER2+ BCSCs. Our findings suggest that the presence of HER2- BCSCs may be responsible for primary trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ BC cell population.

Ten of the 19 SEC tumors (53%) had an HRD score &gt; 42, considered to reflect an HRD phenotype. Higher HRD score was associated with loss of heterozygosity in key HRD genes, and copy-number signatures associated with non-BRCA1/2 dependent HRD in HGSOC.

This leads to an accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in many tissues, which results in progressive damage to the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. We present the molecular and clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of FD patients from a multidisciplinary clinic at the University of California, Irvine treated with agalsidase beta enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for 2-20 years. This cohort comprised 24 adults (11 males, 13 females) and two male children (median age 45; range 10-68 years). Of the 26 patients in this cohort, 20 were on ERT (12 males, 8 females). We describe one novel variant not previously reported in the literature in a patient with features of 'classic' FD. The vast majority of patients in this cohort presented with symptoms of 'classic' FD including peripheral neuropathic pain, some form of cardiac involvement, angiokeratomas, corneal verticillata, hypohidrosis, tinnitus, and gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily abdominal pain. The majority of males had clinically evident renal involvement. An annual eGFR reduction of -1.88 mL/min/1.73 m2/yr during the course of ERT was seen in this cohort. The most common renal presentation was proteinuria, and one individual required a renal transplant. Other common findings were pulmonary involvement, lymphedema, hearing loss, and significantly, three patients had strokes. Notably, there was a high prevalence of endocrine dysfunction and low bone mineral density, including several with osteoporosis. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) cleared plasma GL-3 in this cohort, there was limited improvement in renal function or health-related quality of life based on the patient-reported SF-36 Health Survey. Physical functioning significantly declined over the course of ERT treatment, which may be, in part, due to the late initiation of ERT in several patients.

33422100,2021,1,1750-1172,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,A new UHPLC-MS/MS method for the screening of urinary oligosaccharides expands the detection of storage disorders.,10.1186/s13023-020-01662-8,"Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":Oligosaccharidoses are storage disorders due to enzymatic defects involved in the breakdown of the oligosaccharidic component of glycosylated proteins. The defect cause the accumulation of oligosaccharides (OS) and, depending on the lacking enzyme, results in characteristic profiles which are helpful for the diagnosis. We developed a new tandem mass spectrometry method for the screening of urinary OS which was applied to identify a large panel of storage disorders.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":The method was set-up in urine and dried urine spots (DUS). Samples were analysed, without derivatization and using maltoheptaose as internal standard, by UHPLC-MS/MS with MRM acquisition of target OS transitions, including Glc4, the biomarker of Pompe disease. The chromatographic run was &lt; 30 min. Samples from patients with known storage disorders were used for clinical validation.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The method allowed to confirm the diagnosis of oligosaccharidoses (sialidosis, α-/β-mannosidosis, fucosidosis, aspartylglucosaminuria) and of GM1 and GM2 (Sandhoff type) gangliosidosis, by detecting specific OS profiles. In other storage disorders (mucolipidosis II and III, mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB) the analyisis revealed abnormal OS excretion with non-specific profiles. Besides Pompe disease, the tetrasaccharide Glc4 was increased also in disorders of autophagy (Vici syndrome, Yunis-Varon syndrome, and Danon disease) presenting cardiomuscular involvement with glycogen storage. Overall, results showed a clear separation between patients and controls, both in urine and in DUS.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This new UHPLC/MS-MS method, which is suitable for rapid and easy screening of OS in urine and DUS, expands the detection of storage disorders from oligosaccharidoses to other diseases, including the novel category of inherited disorders of autophagy.",eng,Orphanet J Rare Dis,101266602,1750-1172,epublish,33422100,10.1186/s13023-020-01662-8,16,1,Orphanet J Rare Dis
