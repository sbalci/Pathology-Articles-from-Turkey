Tumors located exclusively in the deep lobe are not common and 20% of parotid gland tumors originate from deep lobe under the branches of the facial nerve. Accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) procedure in salivary gland tumors have been studied extensively, however there isn't any data regarding usefulness of FNAB in tumors located exclusively in deep lobe of parotid gland. In this study we aimed to assess the use of FNAB in deep lobe parotid tumors.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with deep lobe parotid tumors who underwent surgery in our clinic between January 2013-December 2018. Characteristics of patients were recorded. Preoperative FNAB results and postoperative final histopathologic diagnosis were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 24.0 was used for statistical analysis.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The number of patients that met the inclusion criteria was 51. The mean age of patients were 49.2(14-86). In 40 (78.4) of the patients, tumor was reported as benign and in 11 (21.6) patients FNAB diagnosis was suspicious for malignancy, malignant or non-diagnostic. In final histopathologic diagnosis, 42 of the tumors were benign and 9 were malignant. The most common benign tumor type was pleomorphic adenoma which constitutes 27 of the cases (52.9%). Regarding detection of malignant disease, the sensitivity of FNAB was 90.4%, specificity was 77.7%, positive predictive value was 95%, negative predictive value was 63.6%. There was a substantial agreement between FNAB and final histopathologic diagnosis(kappa = 0,628).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":FNAB is a safe and reliable tool to evaluate deep lobe parotid tumors. It is an important part of preoperative surgical planning and can help the surgeon in patient counseling. FNAB with ultrasound guidance is recommended for deep lobe tumors.",eng,Am J Otolaryngol,8000029,0196-0709,ppublish,33045535,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102590,42,1,Am J Otolaryngol

Here we report that activin-A, after binding to its cognate receptors induces a functional luteolytic state and reverses luteinization phenotype by downregulating the expression of the steroidogenic enzymes, LH receptor and VEGF and reducing estradiol (E2) progesterone (P4) production and upregulating FSH receptor and cyclin D1 expression in human primary luteinized granulosa cells. Further, this action of activin-A involves downregulation of JNK signaling pathway and is opposite to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which acts as a luteotropic hormone and improves luteal function through the activation of JNK pathway in the same cell type. Reversal of luteinization phenotype in luteal granulosa cells by activin-A potentially makes this hormone an attractive candidate for use under certain clinical situations, where induction of luteolysis and rapid reduction of endogenous sex steroid levels are beneficial such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), in which the ovaries hyper-respond to gonadotropin stimulation by producing too many growing follicles along with development of ascites, pleural effusion, and hemo-concentrations as a result of increased vascular permeability and leakage of intravascular volume into third spaces.

However, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems exist, and consensus is lacking as to which system represents best practice. An international consensus meeting on TRS took place in November 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, we provide an overview of the outcomes and consensus statements that originated from this meeting. Consensus (≥80% agreement) was reached on a total of seven statements: (1) TRS is important because it provides information about the effect of neoadjuvant treatment that is not provided by other histopathology-based descriptors. (2) TRS for resected PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy should assess residual (viable) tumor burden instead of tumor regression. (3) The CAP scoring system is considered the most adequate scoring system to date because it is based on the presence and amount of residual cancer cells instead of tumor regression. (4) The defining criteria of the categories in the CAP scoring system should be improved by replacing subjective terms including &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot; with objective criteria to evaluate the extent of viable tumor. (5) The improved, consensus-based system should be validated retrospectively and prospectively. (6) Prospective studies should determine the extent of tissue sampling that is required to ensure adequate assessment of the residual cancer burden, taking into account the heterogeneity of tumor response.

The protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase-1 (NQO1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were measured with ELISA; the immunopositivity of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and caspase 3 were determined with immunohistochemistry; the mRNA transcript levels of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase 3, protein kinase B1/2 (Akt-1/2), and forkhead box transcription factor, class O1 (FOXO1) were determined with RT-PCR. The reduction of Nrf2 levels and HO-1 and NQO1 activities in the sciatic nerve tissue, the increase in the levels of 8-OHdG, and the increase in the levels of GFAP and NF-κB caused by vincristine was observed to cause oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, neuronal cell damage, and inflammation, respectively. Additionally, vincristine was determined to cause ER stress and apoptosis by increasing PERK, IRE1, ATF-6, and GRP78 and caspase 3 and Bax expressions and by decreasing Bcl-2 expressions. Vincristine causing Akt inhibition also shows that it prevents neuronal survival.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Median duration of disease onset after the ABS was 16 (8-38) months. After the diagnosis of GM was obtained, all patients received steroid treatment. Median steroid treatment duration was 10 (8-20) weeks. Methotrexate was administered in two patients due to persistent breast mass and steroid side effect. Surgical excision was performed in three patients with wide excision. No patient needed further surgery such as mastectomy. Median follow-up period was 37.5 (18-70) months.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This is the first study to declare GM in patients who underwent ABS. Atypical clinical presentation such as breast abscess, mass or fistula after ABS should alert the surgeon about GM. Unlike other mastitis, the primary treatment of this rare disease is steroid and immunosuppressive treatment. Insufficient knowledge about GM can lead to unnecessary surgeries or breast loss.

To determine why individuals with MRS specifically lack pancreatic endocrine cells, we micro-CT imaged a 12-week-old foetus homozygous for the nonsense mutation RFX6 c.1129C&gt;T, which revealed loss of the pancreas body and tail. From this foetus, we derived iPSCs and show that differentiation of these cells in vitro proceeds normally until generation of pancreatic endoderm, which is significantly reduced. We additionally generated an RFX6HA reporter allele by gene targeting in wild-type H9 cells to precisely define RFX6 expression and in parallel performed in situ hybridisation for RFX6 in the dorsal pancreatic bud of a Carnegie stage 14 human embryo. Both in vitro and in vivo, we find that RFX6 specifically labels a subset of PDX1-expressing pancreatic endoderm. In summary, RFX6 is essential for efficient differentiation of pancreatic endoderm, and its absence in individuals with MRS specifically impairs formation of endocrine cells of the pancreas head and tail.",eng,Development,8701744,0950-1991,epublish,33033118,10.1242/dev.194878,147,21,Development

An experimental study.,10.1080/2000656X.2020.1828901,"Recently, most of the immediate breast reconstructions following mastectomy are being carried out with the use of silicone implants. In these patients, methylene blue is being used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. This experimental study was performed to determine the effect of methylene blue on capsular contracture around breast implants. Thirty-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Custom made silicone blocks were placed on the back of animals. In group 1, the incision was closed without performing any additional procedure. In group 2 (control), 0.1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was instilled into the pocket. Group 3 and 4 (study groups) received 0.1 and 0.2 mL of 1% methylene blue, respectively. On postoperative day 60, implants and capsular tissue were extracted. Capsule formation was evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. The histological evaluation included capsule thickness, inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis gradients. Regarding capsule thickness, there were statistically significant differences between groups 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, and 2-4. Although there were more moderate and severe inflammation gradients in groups III and IV, there was no significant difference regarding inflammation severity between control and study groups. In respect of vascular proliferation, there was a statistically significant difference between control and study groups. Similarly, fibrosis gradients were higher in both groups 3 and 4. The study showed that the injection of methylene blue around silicone implants enhanced the formation of capsular contracture. In this case, the degree of contracture was independent of the dose given.

We aimed to assess the association of tumour markers with histopathological structure of ovarian endometriomas to assess their roles in clinical management. Data from 86 women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma were evaluated. The possible risk factors for inadvertently removed normal ovarian parenchyma (IRNOP) during laparoscopic cystectomy and the relationship between tumour markers and histopathologic parameters of ovarian endometrioma were assessed. Age and the depth of penetration of endometrial tissue into the cyst wall showed a significant positive correlation with thickness of IRNOP. There was a significant negative correlation between IRNOP and the thickness of fibrosis on cyst wall. Thickness of fibrosis and the depth of penetration represented significant positive correlations with tumour markers (CA 125, CA 15-3, and CA 19-9), respectively. This is the first study that reveals the association between tumour markers and the histopathologic features of ovarian endometrioma. The outcome of the present study indicated that lower levels of tumour markers may permit a conservative management, rising levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and high levels may help in counselling postoperative outcomes. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Endometriosis is defined as a benign gynaecologic disease, and the vast majority of women who suffer from endometriosis are of reproductive age. Ovarian endometriotic cysts are found in one-fifth to one-half of patients with endometriosis. Laparoscopic cystectomy is accepted as the gold standard for the surgical management of ovarian endometriotic cysts because of the procedure's several clinical advantages, such as lower recurrence and higher pregnancy rates. However, studies have indicated that laparoscopic excision of an ovarian endometrioma capsule could be associated with a reduction in both the ovarian volume and the follicle count. What do the results of this study add? Our retrospective data indicate that tumour markers may have role in planning the management of ovarian endometriomas. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Low tumour markers levels may permit a conservative management, elevating levels may help in timing of a possible surgical intervention and finally high levels may help in counselling the patient about her possible postoperative outcomes.",eng,J Obstet Gynaecol,8309140,0144-3615,aheadofprint,33054460,10.1080/01443615.2020.1791060,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":During the study period, 89 children met the inclusion criteria. Patients were followed for a median of 8.0 years. A total of 39 (44%) patients were diagnosed with EGID after transplantation. Of these, 29 (33%) had eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and 10 (11%) had eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis. In comparison with the non-EGID group, patients with EGID were younger at transplant (P ≤ 0.0001), transplanted more frequently due to biliary atresia (P ≤ 0.0001), and had higher rates of pretransplant allergy (P = 0.019). In the posttransplant period, they had higher rates of mammalian Target of Rapamycin inhibitor use (P = 0.006), Epstein-Barr virus viremia (P = 0.03), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (P = 0.005), and allergen sensitization (P ≤ 0.0001). In regression analysis, young age at transplant, age at diagnosis, pretransplant atopic dermatitis, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease were associated with an increased risk of EGID or EoE. Laboratory abnormalities such as anemia (P = 0.007), thrombocytosis (P = 0.012), and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.031) were more commonly observed in the eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis or enterocolitis group than in the EoE group.

Plasma samples were collected on the same day of diagnosis and before any immunosuppressive treatment was initiated. At the time of diagnosis and sample collection, none of the patients had renal involvement. We used Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) to investigate the alterations in plasma metabolomic profiles. Three separate pools were created: healthy controls (group C), active IgAV patients who did not develop renal involvement (group H), and patients who developed IgAVN at follow up (group N).

Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Retrospective database research was conducted. Sixty nine meningioma and 15 schwannoma having DSC-PI between January 2016 and February 2020 were included. Time to signal intensity curves (TSIC) were analyzed and grouped as T1-dominant leakage, T2*-dominant leakage and return to baseline. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative mean transit time (rMTT), percentage signal recovery 1 (PSR 1) and PSR 2 values were calculated. The differences between the groups were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were operated.

The role of oophorectomy is yet to be established. We aimed to examine the effect of preserving the ovaries on the pattern of recurrences in patients with stage I disease. Thirty-four patients with stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma were retrospectively analysed. Based on ovarian preservation the whole cohort was divided into two groups. Recurrence (liver, lung, groin and bone) was detected in 4 (11.8%) cases. No significant differences in overall survival or disease-free survival (DFS) were observed between the ovarian preservation and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) groups. Subset analysis revealed no significant difference in DFS between the ovarian preservation and BSO groups in the premenopausal arm. And also, the performance of pelvic (n = 2) or para-aortic lymphadenectomy (n = 6) or adjuvant hormonal therapy did not alter DFS significantly. The 5-year DFS rate for the group which received adjuvant radiotherapy was 62.5 and 94.4% for those which did not (p = .014). Preserving the ovaries had no adverse effect on the recurrence of stage I disease. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Due to the rarity of the disease and the common postoperative diagnosis, only retrospective studies have been reported on low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. This disease is commonly diagnosed in premenopausal patients during the early stage. There is no consensus on preserving the ovaries, particularly in young patients, due to the tumour's hormonal characteristics and the risk of late recurrences. What do the results of this study add? Ovarian preservation had no effect on the recurrence of stage I low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Lymphadenectomy and adjuvant hormonal treatment had no effect on DFS, and adjuvant radiotherapy decreased DFS in the current study. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

PI3K-activated tumors recurred earlier than other subgroups, but had intermediate long-term outcome. Among low-grade tumors, HH and TRAF7 meningiomas exhibited elevated recurrence compared to other subgroups. Recurrence of NF2 tumors was associated with male gender, high-grade, and elevated Ki-67.

Melatonin might be able to change the pathophysiological process and prognosis into a positive way that might prevent and heal endometrial hyperplasia, which is the first stage of endometrial cancer. For this perspective, we tried to investigate the effect of melatonin on uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in an experimental rat model. Forty Wistar-Albino rats were undergone bilateral oophorectomy and randomized into four groups. To create a model of uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia in all groups, except the control group [C] (n = 10), 4 mg/kg/day estradiol hemihydrate were given for 14 days. The uterine hypertrophy/hyperplasia was evaluated histopathologically in the left uterine horns, then the groups were treated for 14 days as follows; melatonin (10 mg/kg/day/po) [M] (n = 10), melatonin + estradiol hemihydrate (10 mg/kg/day/po and 4 mg/kg/day/po) [M + E] (n = 10), and dark environment [D] (n = 10).

Leveraging a 3D rat primary neural organotypic in vitro model (rat brainsphere), we compare developmental neurotoxic effects of BDE-47-the most abundant PBDE congener-with four OPFR (isopropylated phenyl phosphate-IPP, triphenyl phosphate-TPHP, isodecyl diphenyl phosphate-IDDP, and tricresyl phosphate (also known as trimethyl phenyl phosphate)-TMPP). Employing mass spectroscopy-based metabolomics and transcriptomics, we observe at similar human-relevant non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.1-5 µM) stronger developmental neurotoxic effects by OPFR. This includes toxicity to neurons in the low µM range; all FR decrease the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (except BDE-47 and TPHP). Furthermore, n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), considered a neurologic diagnostic molecule, was decreased by all OPFR. At similar concentrations, the FR currently in use decreased plasma membrane dopamine active transporter expression, while BDE-47 did not. Several findings suggest astrogliosis induced by the OPFR, but not BDE-47. At the 5 µM concentrations, the OPFR more than BDE-47 interfered with myelination. An increase of cytokine gene and receptor expressions suggests that exposure to OPFR may induce an inflammatory response.

Papillary tumor of the pineal region is considered one of four pineal parenchymal tumors according to the 2007 World Health Organisation classification of central nervous system tumors. It is mostly seen in the middle age and it is rare under the age of 17 in the literature. In this report, we aim to present a case with papillary tumor of the pineal region with both CT and MRI findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis. Case report: A 17-year-old female patient who underwent a treatment of ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus 18 months ago applied to the neurosurgery clinic with nausea, vomiting, sensorineural hearing loss and Parinaud syndrome continuing through 1 month. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been applied. A 58x31x38 mm mass with cystic and mild hyperdense soft tissue components was observed in the localization of pineal gland and posterior comissure on non-enhanced CT. MRI examination revealed that the mass filled the pineal region, contained solid and large cystic components, and hyperintense on T1-weighted images. After intravenous contrast media injection, the mass enhanced more peripherally. DW-MRI showed that there is a diffusion restriction in some parts of the soft tissue components. The mass was totally resected, and pathology report revealed that it is a papillary tumor of the pineal region.

While its prognosis is generally favorable, disease recurrence is relatively frequent. Because morbidity after repeated surgery may be significant, an optimized prediction of recurrence-free survival (RFS) has the potential to improve current management strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the Ki-67 proliferation index with respect to RFS in patients with DFSP. We retrospectively analyzed data from 45 patients with DFSP. We calculated the Ki-67 proliferation index as the percentage of immunostained nuclei among the total number of tumor cell nuclei regardless of the intensity of immunostaining. We constructed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify predictors of RFS. Among the 45 patients included in the study, 8 developed local recurrences and 2 had lung metastases (median follow-up: 95.0 months; range: 5.2-412.4 months). The RFS rates at 60, 120, and 240 months of follow-up were 83.8%, 76.2%, and 65.3%, respectively. The median Ki-67 proliferation index was 14%. Notably, we identified the Ki-67 proliferation index as the only independent predictor for RFS in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio = 1.106, 95% confidence interval = 1.019-1.200, p = 0.016).

A Literature Review and Case Report.,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,"The relationship between the endocrine system and autoimmunity has been recognized for a long time and one of the best examples of autoimmune endocrine disease is autoimmune hypophysitis. A better understanding of autoimmune mechanisms and radiological, biochemical, and immunological developments have given rise to the definition of new autoimmune disorders including autoimmunity-related hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. However, whether hypothalamitis may occur as a distinct entity, is still matter of debate. Here we describe a 35-year-old woman with growing suprasellar mass, partial empty sella, central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, and hyperprolactinemia. Histopathologic examination of surgically removed suprasellar mass revealed lymphocytic infiltrate suggestive of an autoimmune disease with hypothalamic involvement. The presence of anti-hypothalamus antibodies to AVP-secreting cells (AVPcAb) at high titers and the absence of anti-pituitary antibodies suggested the diagnosis of isolated hypothalamitis. Some similar conditions have sometimes been reported in the literature but the simultaneous double finding of lymphocytic infiltrate and the presence of AVPcAb so far has never been reported. We think that the hypothalamitis can be considered a new isolated autoimmune disease affecting the hypothalamus while the lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis can be a consequence of hypothalamitis with subsequent autoimmune involvement of the pituitary. To our knowledge this is the first observation of autoimmune hypothalamic involvement with central diabetes insipidus, partial empty sella, anti-hypothalamic antibodies and hypopituitarism.",eng,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,0375362,0021-972X,aheadofprint,33104773,10.1210/clinem/dgaa771,NA,NA,J Clin Endocrinol Metab

In ovarian cases, more MCs were counted overall in the necrotizing group, but there were fewer vascular structures. The increase in the number of MC and vascular structures in lungs and stomach in the non-necrotizing group supports the theory that MCs are involved in tumor progression.

INH treatment also increased levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activities of p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) while decreasing levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Double immunofluorescence expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in brain tissues were increased after INH administration. Furthermore, INH increased mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm), glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), NF-κB, TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GFAP in rat brain tissues. Co-treatment with CR increased anti-oxidant capacity as well as regulated inflammation and apoptosis in brain. Additionally, molecular docking results showed that CR had the potential to interact with the active sites of TNF-α and NFκ-B. In conclusion, CR improved INH-induced brain oxidative damage, inflammation and apoptosis, possibly through their antioxidant properties.",eng,Neurotoxicology,7905589,0161-813X,ppublish,33121995,10.1016/j.neuro.2020.10.009,81,NA,Neurotoxicology

Regarding these parameters, in cisplatin group NF-ƘB, MDA and TOS levels were statistically significantly increased with cisplatin administration and giving taxifolin concomitantly with cisplatin prevented this elevation. On the other hand, tGSH and TAS levels were statistically significantly decreased with cisplatin administration and routine simultaneous application of taxifolin with cisplatin prevented this decrease. In histopathological findings, haemorrhage was observed in the perineum of the injured optic nerves in the cisplatin treated group. And also edoema and degeneration in nerve fascicles in damaged optic nerves were seen in the cisplatin group. In the taxifolin treated group histopathological examinations were close to normal appearance, except mild edoema in nerve fascicles.

Investigating other specific substrates of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities may illuminate how it performs these diverse functions in mammalian cells. We report that macrophage IRE1 plays an unprecedented role in regulating phosphatidylinositide-derived signaling lipid metabolites and has profound impact on the downstream signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This cross-talk between UPR and mTOR pathways occurs through the unconventional maturation of microRNA (miR) 2137 by IRE1's RNase activity.

In addition to that, poststroke neuroregeneration is stimulated upon transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium further enhances the neuroregenerative potential of MSCs, which act by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs). The present work analyzed, whether MSC preconditioning with lithium modifies EV secretion patterns, enhancing the therapeutic potential of such derived EVs (Li-EVs) in comparison with EVs enriched from native MSCs. Indeed, Li-EVs significantly enhanced the resistance of cultured astrocytes, microglia, and neurons against hypoxic injury when compared with controls and to native EV-treated cells. Using a stroke mouse model, intravenous delivery of Li-EVs increased neurological recovery and neuroregeneration for as long as 3 months in comparison with controls and EV-treated mice, albeit the latter also showed significantly better behavioral test performance compared with controls. Preconditioning of MSCs with lithium also changed the secretion patterns for such EVs, modifying the contents of various miRNAs within these vesicles. As such, Li-EVs displayed significantly increased levels of miR-1906, which has been shown to be a new regulator of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Li-EVs reduced posthypoxic and postischemic TLR4 abundance, resulting in an inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, decreased proteasomal activity, and declined both inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, all of which culminating in reduced levels of poststroke cerebral inflammation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in termination of IL2 activation are largely unknown in human NK cells. PR/SET domain 1 was previously reported to decrease cell growth and increase apoptosis in an IL2-dependent manner in malignant NK cell lines, suggesting the possibility of down-regulation of IL2 signaling pathway gene(s) through direct transcriptional repression. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified a PRDM1 binding site on the first intron of CD25 (IL2RA), which codes for the IL2 receptor subunit regulating sensitivity to IL2 signaling, in primary NK cells activated with engineered K562 cells or IL2. Ectopic expression of PRDM1 down-regulated CD25 expression at transcript and protein levels in two PRDM1 nonexpressing NK cell lines. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD25 in two malignant NK cell lines led to progressive depletion of NK cells in low IL2 concentrations. By contrast, ectopic CD25 expression in primary human NK cells led to progressive increase in cell number in CD25-transduced cells in low IL2 concentrations. Altogether these results reveal a pivotal role of PRDM1 in inhibition of IL2-induced NK cell expansion through direct repression of CD25 in activated human NK cells. These observations provide additional support for the role of PRDM1 in attenuation of NK cell activation and growth, with implications on neoplastic transformation or NK cell function when it is deregulated.",eng,J Leukoc Biol,8405628,0741-5400,aheadofprint,33145806,10.1002/JLB.2A0520-321RR,NA,NA,J Leukoc Biol

In recent years, many studies revealed the inflammatory nature of endometriosis. Many of the immune cells and their secretory products cytokines and chemokines has been detected in body fluids of women with endometriosis. Cytokines are protein or glycoprotein in structures and hormon-like molecules that act generally in a paracrine fashion to regulate immun responses.

MSI status is assessed to detect Lynch syndrome, guide adjuvant chemotherapy, determine prognosis, and use as a companion test for checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Traditionally, MSI status is determined by immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. The Idylla™ MSI Assay is a fully automated molecular method (including automated result interpretation), using seven novel MSI biomarkers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A, SULF2) and not requiring matched normal tissue. In this real-world global study, 44 clinical centers performed Idylla™ testing on a total of 1301 archived colorectal cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and compared Idylla™ results against available results from routine diagnostic testing in those sites. MSI mutations detected with the Idylla™ MSI Assay were equally distributed over the seven biomarkers, and 84.48% of the MSI-high samples had ≥ 5 mutated biomarkers, while 98.25% of the microsatellite-stable samples had zero mutated biomarkers.

Vasopressin acts primarily to reabsorb water via urinary concentration. However, fat is also a source of metabolic water, raising the possibility that vasopressin might have a role in fat accumulation. Fructose has also been reported to stimulate vasopressin. Here we tested the hypothesis that fructose induced metabolic syndrome is mediated by vasopressin. Orally administered fructose, glucose or high fructose corn syrup increased vasopressin (copeptin) concentrations and was mediated by fructokinase, an enzyme specific for fructose metabolism. Suppressing vasopressin with hydration both prevented and ameliorated fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. The vasopressin effects were mediated by the Vasopressin 1b receptor, as Vasopressin 1b receptor knockout mice were completely protected while V1a knockout paradoxically showed worse metabolic syndrome. The mechanism is likely mediated in part by de novo expression of V1b in the liver that amplifies fructokinase expression in response to fructose. Thus, our studies document a new role for vasopressin in water conservation via the accumulation of fat as a source of metabolic water. Clinically, it also suggests that increased water intake may be a beneficial way to both prevent or treat metabolic syndrome.",eng,JCI Insight,101676073,2379-3708,aheadofprint,33320834,10.1172/jci.insight.140848,NA,NA,JCI Insight

Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis.

Subsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard et al. 2015 Studies in Mycology 80: 189-245) who proposed dividing Fusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus Neocosmospora, with subsequent justification based on claims that the Geiser et al. (2013) concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic (Sandoval-Denis et al. 2018; Persoonia 41:109-129). Here we test this claim, and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as Neocosmospora were recombined in Fusarium, and nine others were renamed Fusarium. Here the global Fusarium community voices strong support for the inclusion of the FSSC in Fusarium, as it remains the best scientific, nomenclatural and practical taxonomic option available.",eng,Phytopathology,9427222,0031-949X,aheadofprint,33200960,10.1094/PHYTO-08-20-0330-LE,NA,NA,Phytopathology

Transcriptomic profiling studies have thus far revealed the presence of molecular subtypes of AML that are not accounted for by standard clinical parameters or by routinely used biomarkers. Such molecular subtypes of AML are predicted to vary in response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is an important group of proteins that play a critical role in regulating blood pressure, vascular resistance and fluid/electrolyte balance. RAS pathway genes are also known to be present locally in tissues such as the bone marrow, where they play an important role in leukemic hematopoiesis. In this study, we asked if the RAS genes could be utilized to predict drug responses in patients with AML. We show that the combined in silico analysis of up to five RAS genes can reliably predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin as well as Etoposide in AML. The same genes could also predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin when tested in vitro. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of TNF-alpha and type-I IFN response genes among sensitive, and TGF-beta and fibronectin related genes in resistant cancer cells.

For this purpose, 40 male Wistar albino rats were used. The animals were assigned to the following 4 groups: control group (received corn oil vehicle alone), diosmin-treated group (50 mg/kg bw/day orally), deltamethrin-exposed group (5 mg/kg bw/day, orally) and coadministered group (5 mg/kg bw/day deltamethrin and 50 mg/kg bw/day diosmin, orally) for 28 days. Some lipid peroxidation/antioxidant status/biochemical markers were evaluated in blood/tissue (liver, kidney, brain, heart and testis) samples and the histopathological architecture was assessed. Compared with the control group, no alteration was detected in the parameters and histological findings of the diosmin-treated group. Deltamethrin toxicity was associated with significantly increased plasma, cardiac, hepatic, renal, cerebral and testicular levels of MDA and NO, and significantly decreased GSH levels (p &lt; 0.05). Antioxidant enzyme status (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities) displayed either decrease or increase (p &lt; 0.05). Significant increase was detected in AST and ALT activities and urea and creatinine levels (p &lt; 0.05). The values of the group coadministered with deltamethrin and diosmin were similar to the values of the control group. Diosmin ameliorated deltamethrin-induced lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration and subendocardial oedema in the heart. Combined administration also minimized hepatic, renal, testicular and cerebral histopathological findings. The alterations detected in various toxicological parameters correlated well with the histopathological changes observed in various organs. In conclusion, it is suggested that diosmin could provide protection against deltamethrin-induced toxicity and organ damage in rats.",eng,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,9441769,0944-1344,aheadofprint,33242198,10.1007/s11356-020-11277-y,NA,NA,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int

Rejuveinix (RJX) is an intravenous formulation of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Its active ingredients include ascorbic acid, cyanocobalamin, thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin 5' phosphate, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and calcium D-pantothenate. RJX is being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant treatment platform for patients with sepsis, including COVID-19 patients with viral sepsis and ARDS. Here, we report its clinical safety profile in a phase 1 clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) and its potent protective activity in the lipopolysaccharide galactosamine (LPS-GalN) mouse model of ARDS. Methods: A phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-part, ascending dose-escalation study was performed in participating 76 healthy volunteer human subjects in compliance with the ICH (E6) good clinical practice guidelines to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RJX (Protocol No. RPI003; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105). The ability of RJX to prevent fatal shock, ARDS, and multi-organ failure was examined in the well-established LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Standard methods were employed for the statistical analysis of data in both studies. Findings: In the phase 1 clinical study, no participant developed serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 3-Grade 4 adverse events (AEs) or prematurely discontinued participation in the study. In the non-clinical study, RJX exhibited potent and dose-dependent protective activity, decreased the inflammatory cytokine responses (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta), and improved survival in the LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Histopathological examinations showed that RJX attenuated the LPS-GalN induced acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary edema as well as liver damage. Conclusion: RJX showed a very favorable safety profile and tolerability in human subjects.

Since oxidative stress causes pathological changes in neuronal structures antioxidant compounds gained significant attention the last decades. Although several antioxidant compounds showed neuroprotective actions in Parkinson's disease models, only a few of them demonstrated protective effects against loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons. Idebenone is an analog of the well-known antioxidant compound coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Clinical safety of idebenone is well described, and due to its high antioxidant capacity currently used to treat Freidrich's ataxia and Alzheimer's disease. Like Parkinson's disease, these diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial balance in neurons. However, knowledge about the effects of idebenone on Parkinson's disease is limited. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate and delineate the possible effects of idebenone in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease models. Idebenone (200 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the decrease of striatal expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase[quinone]-1, which is an essential element for mitochondrial respiration. Idebenone decreased the striatal levels of the lipid peroxidation products and increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx-4), which is primarily known for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, idebenone mitigated motor impairment and increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron survival. Together our results thus indicate that that idebenone has protective effects against a rotenone insult with pleiotropic actions on the cellular oxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation.",eng,Neurochem Res,7613461,0364-3190,aheadofprint,33247801,10.1007/s11064-020-03186-w,NA,NA,Neurochem Res

For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect p-value&lt; 0.05, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) assessment was used, classifying the evidence from very low to high. From 184 abstracts initially identified, 11 meta-analyses (for a total of 34 outcomes) were included. Half of the outcomes were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that stem cells are more useful than placebo. High certainty of evidence supports the associations of the use of stem cells with a better left ventricular end systolic volume and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in acute myocardial infarction; improved exercise time in refractory angina; a significant lower risk of amputation rate in critical limb ischemia; a higher successful rate in complete healing in case of lower extremities ulcer; and better values of LVEF in systolic heart failure, as compared to placebo.

Previous clinical studies on montelukast have reported conflicting results and, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies concerning these side effects had been conducted. In the current study, the effect of montelukast on depression-like behavior in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model was investigated. A total of 3 OVA challenges were applied at 2 week intervals for the persistence of asthma. Depression-like behavior was assessed using forced swim tests following each challenge and locomotor activities were evaluated using open field tests. At the end of the current study, plasma montelukast concentrations were measured and the development of asthma and effect of montelukast treatment were histopathologically examined. Inflammation scores that were increased in the OVA mice following all challenges were indicated to be reduced by montelukast treatment. The immobility time of mice increased beginning with the first challenge and this was also reduced by montelukast treatment. Montelukast administration to the control mice did not alter immobility times. Moreover, motor activity of the OVA and montelukast-treated mice were not altered. The results indicated there was no association between chronic montelukast treatment and depression. Furthermore, the chronic administration of montelukast to non-asthmatic mice did not increase immobility. However, depressive behavior increased at all time points in the OVA mice. These results indicated that chronic montelukast treatment is not associated with depression-like behavior and confirmed the association between asthma and depression.

Combined efforts from farmers, animal scientists, and veterinarians have been continuing to explore the effective disease control approaches for the production of safe animal-originated food. Implementing the immunogenomics, along with genome editing technology, has been considering as the key approach for safe food-animal production through the improvement of the host genetic resistance. Next-generation sequencing, as a cutting-edge technique, enables the production of high throughput transcriptomic and genomic profiles resulted from host-pathogen interactions. Immunogenomics combine the transcriptomic and genomic data that links to host resistance to disease, and predict the potential candidate genes and their genomic locations. Genome editing, which involves insertion, deletion, or modification of one or more genes in the DNA sequence, is advancing rapidly and may be poised to become a commercial reality faster than it has thought. The clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) [CRISPR/Cas9] system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in agricultural food production including livestock disease management. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated insertion of NRAMP1 gene for producing tuberculosis resistant cattle, and deletion of CD163 gene for producing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) resistant pigs are two groundbreaking applications of genome editing in livestock.

Treated hepatocytes with KA attenuated palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and downregulated lipogenesis-associated genes as well as ER stress markers in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, KA augmented AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) expression, and autophagy markers. The small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and ORP150, or 3-methyladenine also abrogated the effects of KA on ER stress and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In accordance with in vitro observations, KA administration to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes as well as ER stress. Moreover, KA treatment increased hepatic AMPK phosphorylation, ORP150 expression, and autophagy related markers in mouse livers. Knockdown of AMPK using in vivo transfection mitigated the effects of KA on hepatic steatosis and ER stress as well as autophagy and ORP150 expression. These results suggest that KA ameliorates hepatic steatosis via the AMPK/autophagy- and AMPK/ORP150-mediated suppression of ER stress. In sum, KA might be used as a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of NAFLD.",eng,J Cell Physiol,0050222,0021-9541,aheadofprint,33283879,10.1002/jcp.30199,NA,NA,J Cell Physiol

Numerous mutational processes leave marks on the genome in the form of mutations, copy number alterations, rearrangements or their combinations. To explore gliomagenesis, we hypothesized that gliomas with different underlying oncogenic mechanisms would have differences in the burden of various forms of these genomic alterations. This was an analysis on adult diffuse gliomas, but IDH-mutant gliomas as well as diffuse midline gliomas H3-K27M were excluded to search for the possible presence of new entities among the very heterogenous group of IDH-WT glioblastomas. The cohort was divided into two molecular subsets: (1) Molecularly-defined GBM (mGBM) as those that carried molecular features of glioblastomas (including TERT promoter mutations, 7/10 pattern, or EGFR-amplification), and (2) those who did not (others). Whole exome sequencing was performed for 37 primary tumors and matched blood samples as well as 8 recurrences. Single nucleotide variations (SNV), short insertion or deletions (indels) and copy number alterations (CNA) were quantified using 5 quantitative metrics (SNV burden, indel burden, copy number alteration frequency-wGII, chromosomal arm event ratio-CAER, copy number amplitude) as well as 4 parameters that explored underlying oncogenic mechanisms (chromothripsis, double minutes, microsatellite instability and mutational signatures). Findings were validated in the TCGA pan-glioma cohort. mGBM and &quot;Others&quot; differed significantly in their SNV (only in the TCGA cohort) and CNA metrics but not indel burden. SNV burden increased with increasing age at diagnosis and at recurrences and was driven by mismatch repair deficiency.

The neuroprotective cargo of EVs, however, has not yet been identified. To investigate such cargo and its underlying mechanism, primary neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) and cocultured with adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) or ADMSC-secreted EVs. Under such conditions, both ADMSCs and ADMSC-secreted EVs significantly reduced neuronal death. Screening for signalling cascades being involved in the interaction between ADMSCs and neurons revealed a decreased autophagic flux as well as a declined p53-BNIP3 activity in neurons receiving either treatment paradigm. However, the aforementioned effects were reversed when ADMSCs were pretreated with the inhibitor of exosomal secretion GW4869 or when Hrs was knocked down. In light of miR-25-3p being the most highly expressed miRNA in ADMSC-EVs interacting with the p53 pathway, further in vitro work focused on this pathway. Indeed, a miR-25-3p oligonucleotide mimic reduced cell death, whereas the anti-oligonucleotide increased autophagic flux and cell death by modulating p53-BNIP3 signalling in primary neurons exposed to OGD. Likewise, native ADMSC-EVs but not EVs obtained from ADMSCs pretreated with the anti-miR-25-3p oligonucleotide (ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p) confirmed the aforementioned in vitro observations in C57BL/6 mice exposed to cerebral ischemia. The infarct size was reduced, and neurological recovery was increased in mice treated with native ADMSC-EVs when compared to ADMSC-EVsanti-miR-25-3p. ADMSCs induce neuroprotection by improved autophagic flux through secreted EVs containing miR-25-3p. Hence, our work uncovers a novel key factor in naturally secreted ADMSC-EVs for the regulation of autophagy and induction of neuroprotection in a preclinical stroke model.",eng,J Extracell Vesicles,101610479,2001-3078,ppublish,33304476,10.1002/jev2.12024,10,1,J Extracell Vesicles

Most of the studies investigating PD-L1 expression in endometrial carcinoma have used tissue microarrays and did not examine all tumor blocks. In this study, we analyzed the expression of PD-L1 in resection specimens of 176 consecutive endometrial carcinomas using all tumor blocks; we compared PD-L1 expression in MMR-deficient endometrial carcinomas, including the MLH1 and PMS2-loss subgroup, and the other MMR-loss subgroups (MSH2 and MSH6, isolated PMS2, and isolated MSH6), with the MMR-intact subgroup. MLH1 methylation was performed in tumors with MLH1 and PMS2 loss. Tumor cell (TC) and tumor-associated immune cell (IC) PD-L1 positivity with a 1% cutoff was observed in 21% (n=37) and 66.5% (n=117) of cases, respectively, and with a 5% cutoff in 5.1% (n=9) and 39.8% (n=70) of cases, respectively. MMR protein deficiency was a statistically significant parameter associated with IC PD-L1 positivity, with 1% and 5% cutoffs on multivariate analysis [odds ratio (OR)=5.236, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.075-13.211, P=0.001, and OR=3.702, 95% CI=1.759-7.791, P=0.001, respectively].

Analysis revealed that genes associated with cancer stem cells, such as POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG, BMI1, BMP2, CD44, SOX9, and ALDH1 were markedly upregulated in enzalutamide resistant cells. Amongst the pathways enriched in the enzalutamide-resistant cells were those associated with RUNX2, hedgehog, integrin signaling, and molecules associated with elastic fibers. Further examination of a patient cohort undergoing ADT and its comparison with no-ADT group demonstrated high expression of POU5F1 (OCT4), ALDH1, and SOX2 in ADT specimens, suggesting that they may be clinically relevant therapeutic targets. Altogether, our approach exhibits the potential of integrative transcriptomic analyses to identify critical genes and pathways of antiandrogen resistance as a promising approach for designing novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent drug resistance.",eng,Int J Mol Sci,101092791,1422-0067,epublish,33339129,10.3390/ijms21249568,21,24,Int J Mol Sci

The prevalence of CE depends upon human behavioral risk factors, the diversity and ecology of animal host interactions and the genetic diversity within Echinococcus species which differ in their zoonotic potential and pathogenicity. It is a neglected, economic and socio-cultural problem in Pakistan. The available data about the incidence of CE is very limited and no extensive study has been reported in Pakistan.

All children had normal growth and no sign of chondrodysplasia at birth and prior to their primary disease. After HSCT, all children developed growth failure, with standard deviation scores for height at or below -3. Radiographically, all children had changes in the spine, metaphyses and epiphyses, compatible with a spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. Genomic sequencing failed to detect pathogenic variants in genes associated with osteochondrodysplasias.

In this way, 30 min after rats were given 25 and 50 mg/kg/b.w CHR orally for seven consecutive days, 30 mg/kg/b.w PbAc was administered orally. In biochemical analysis of testicular tissue, it was found that PbAc-reduced antioxidant parameters [glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)], while it increased lipid peroxidation, inflammatory markers [nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)], and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In the immunohistochemical examination, it was determined that PbAc increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and caspase-3. Accordingly, PbAc was found to cause a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in the percentage of dead sperm. However, it has been observed that CHR relieves oxidative stress due to its antioxidant properties, thus protecting against inflammation and apoptosis. It also allowed the CHR sperm parameters to return to control group levels. The results revealed that CHR could be a natural substance to be used in Pb-induced testicular toxicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lead (Pb) is an important environmental contaminant heavy metal. Pb is believed to reduce fertility in men. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the damage caused by Pb to testicular tissue. CHR is an antioxidant substance that occurs naturally in various plants and has various pharmacological properties. In the present study, it was investigated whether CHR has a protective effect against testicular toxicity induced by PbAc. The results revealed that in rats, CHR protects the testicular tissue from PbAc toxicity by showing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, thus bringing sperm parameters closer to normal.",eng,J Food Biochem,7706045,0145-8884,aheadofprint,33368351,10.1111/jfbc.13593,NA,NA,J Food Biochem

Survival analyses were performed in a novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable mouse model of PCa under adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine+/-physostigmine/pyridostigmine (n = 30 mice).

Inhibition of this cancer-cell-intrinsic AChE via pyridostigmine and physostigmine, or administration of acetylcholine (ACh), diminished PCa cell viability and invasion in vitro and in vivo via suppression of pERK signaling, and reduced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the novel genetically-induced, surgically-resectable PCa mouse model, adjuvant co-therapy with AChE blockers had no impact on survival. Accordingly, survival of resected PCa patients did not differ based on tumor AChE expression levels.

In recent years, nuclear imaging methods have gained importance in the diagnosis of IE. The present study aims to investigate the imaging potential of 99mTc-labeled vancomycin ( 99mTc-Vancomycin) as a new agent that would enable the diagnosis of IE in its early stages when it is difficult to diagnose or has small vegetation, in the experimental rat model.

Patient-related factors determining the outcome in SM are largely unknown. Methods: We examined the impact of sex on the clinical features, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in 3403 patients with mastocytosis collected in the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM). The impact of cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations on sex differences was analyzed in a subset of patients. Results: Of all patients enrolled, 55.3% were females. However, a male predominance was found in a subset of advanced SM (AdvSM) patients, namely SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN, 70%; p &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, organomegaly (male: 23% vs. female: 13%, p = 0.007) was more, whereas skin involvement (male: 71% vs. female: 86%, p = 0.001) was less frequent in males. In all patients together, OS (p &lt; 0.0001) was significantly inferior in males, and also within the WHO sub-categories indolent SM, aggressive SM (ASM) and SM-AHN. PFS was significantly (p = 0.0002) worse in males when all patients were grouped together; due to low numbers of events, this significance persisted only in the subcategory smoldering SM.

Somatostatin analogue (SSA)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) have been used in clinical trials and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Focus 3 performed a multidisciplinary Delphi process to deliver a balanced perspective on molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). NETs form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones. These cells, called neuroendocrine cells, can be found throughout the body, but NETs are most often found in the abdomen, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. These tumours may also be found in the lungs, pancreas and adrenal glands. In addition to being rare, NETs are also complex and may be difficult to diagnose. Most NETs are non-functioning; however, a minority present with symptoms related to hypersecretion of bioactive compounds. NETs often do not cause symptoms early in the disease process. When diagnosed, substantial number of patients are already found to have metastatic disease. Several societies' guidelines address Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) management; however, many issues are still debated, due to both the difficulty in acquiring strong clinical evidence in a rare and heterogeneous disease and the different availability of diagnostic and therapeutic options across countries. EANM Focus 3 reached consensus on employing 68gallium-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA)-based PET/CT with diagnostic CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for unknown primary NET detection, metastatic NET, NET staging/restaging, suspected extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and suspected paraganglioma. Consensus was reached on employing 18fluorine-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/CT in neuroendocrine carcinoma, G3 NET and in G1-2 NET with mismatched lesions (CT-positive/[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA-negative). Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was recommended for second line treatment for gastrointestinal NET with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA uptake in all lesions, in G1/G2 NET at disease progression, and in a subset of G3 NET provided all lesions are positive at [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA.

Some PTCs with classical papillae can be totally or partially encapsulated, and these tumors are called &quot;encapsulated&quot; (conventional) variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of this variant, comparing with non-encapsulated conventional type PTC. Among 823 thyroidectomy specimens with PTC diagnosed between 2015 and 2018, 121 tumors from 105 patients (12.75%) were reclassified as encapsulated conventional PTC. In 76 patients, tumors were unifocal. Size, cystic changes, background thyroiditis, psammoma bodies, cervical lymph node metastasis at presentation, capsular/vascular invasion, and immunohistochemical BRAF-V600E expression were evaluated. Ninety-two non-encapsulated conventional PTCs served as control group. Encapsulated cases were predominantly women (73.3%), 56.4% were microcarcinomas, 97.5% had cystic changes, 81.4% were BRAF-V600E positive, and 36.8% of unifocal encapsulated tumors had cervical lymph node metastasis. Thyroiditis and psammoma bodies were detected in nearly half of the encapsulated PTCs. Fourteen percent of the unifocal tumors showed total encapsulation, whereas capsular and vascular invasion was detected in 85.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Encapsulated cases did not show any significant difference from the control group, except for prominent cystic changes (p &lt; 0.001). Relationship between lymph node metastasis at presentation and capsular invasion was statistically significant (p = 0.001), and metastasis was more frequent in cases with extensive capsular invasion (no/minimal invasion versus extensive invasion, p &lt; 0.001). Cystic changes are very common, and this feature deserves mentioning as a morphological characteristic of encapsulated conventional PTCs.

The hypoxic condition is a consequence of an imbalance between rapidly proliferating cells and a vascularization that leads to lower oxygen levels in tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an essential transcription factor contributing to the regulation of hypoxia-associated genes. Some of these genes modulate molecular cascades associated with the Warburg effect and its accompanying pathways and, therefore, represent promising targets for cancer treatment. Current progress in the development of therapeutic approaches brings several promising inhibitors of HIF-1. Flavonoids, widely occurring in various plants, exert a broad spectrum of beneficial effects on human health, and are potentially powerful therapeutic tools against cancer. Recent evidences identified numerous natural flavonoids and their derivatives as inhibitors of HIF-1, associated with the regulation of critical glycolytic components in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase II (HKII), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we discuss the results of most recent studies evaluating the impact of flavonoids on HIF-1 accompanied by the regulation of critical enzymes contributing to the Warburg phenotype.

Recently, studies have demonstrated substantial variation between countries in terms of their approach to sampling gallbladders, and furthermore, that pathologists from different continents apply highly variable criteria in determining stage of invasion in this organ. These findings raised the question of whether these variations in pathologic evaluation could account for the vastly different survival rates of T2 GBC reported in the literature. In this study, survival of 316 GBCs from three countries (Chile n = 137, South Korea n = 105, USA n = 74), all adequately sampled (with a minimum of five tumor sections examined) and histopathologically verified as pT2 (after consensus examination by expert pathologists from three continents), was analyzed. Chilean patients had a significantly worse prognosis based on 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.83, p = 0.002) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.51-3.84, p &lt; 0.001), compared to their South Korean counterparts, even when controlled for age and sex. Comparing the USA to South Korea, the survival differences in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75, p = 0.015) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.14-3.31, p = 0.015) were also pronounced.

In conclusion, the survival of true T2 GBC in properly classified cases is neither as good nor as bad as previously documented in the literature and shows notable geographic differences even in well-sampled cases with consensus histopathologic criteria.

However, CCSST has been noted to have atypical histopathological features, such as epidermotropism, myxoid differentiation and presentation at atypical sites. Here, we present the first reported case of eccrine ductal differentiation in CCSST. The patient, a 21-year-old woman, presented with a lump of 10-year duration sized 3x5 cm on the plantar surface of the fourth and fifth interdigital spaces. There was an increase in size as well as pain and redness over 6 years. Besides the characteristic findings, there were ductal structures in continuity with the upper dermis indicative of ductal differentiation. The tumor stained positively with S100, HMB45 and succinic dehydrogenase; ducts stained positively with EMA and CEA. CCSST was confirmed with cytogenetic analysis showing the translocation associated with EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene.

This leads to an accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in many tissues, which results in progressive damage to the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. We present the molecular and clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of FD patients from a multidisciplinary clinic at the University of California, Irvine treated with agalsidase beta enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for 2-20 years. This cohort comprised 24 adults (11 males, 13 females) and two male children (median age 45; range 10-68 years). Of the 26 patients in this cohort, 20 were on ERT (12 males, 8 females). We describe one novel variant not previously reported in the literature in a patient with features of 'classic' FD. The vast majority of patients in this cohort presented with symptoms of 'classic' FD including peripheral neuropathic pain, some form of cardiac involvement, angiokeratomas, corneal verticillata, hypohidrosis, tinnitus, and gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily abdominal pain. The majority of males had clinically evident renal involvement. An annual eGFR reduction of -1.88 mL/min/1.73 m2/yr during the course of ERT was seen in this cohort. The most common renal presentation was proteinuria, and one individual required a renal transplant. Other common findings were pulmonary involvement, lymphedema, hearing loss, and significantly, three patients had strokes. Notably, there was a high prevalence of endocrine dysfunction and low bone mineral density, including several with osteoporosis. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) cleared plasma GL-3 in this cohort, there was limited improvement in renal function or health-related quality of life based on the patient-reported SF-36 Health Survey. Physical functioning significantly declined over the course of ERT treatment, which may be, in part, due to the late initiation of ERT in several patients.

We mimicked the human RAPs in a mouse model and found that three or more episodes of AP cause early chronic-like morphological changes in the pancreas. We concluded that three or more attacks of AP with no morphological changes to the pancreas could be considered as early CP (ECP).The new diagnostic criteria for ECP allow the majority of CP patients to be diagnosed earlier.

Thus, SEC patients may benefit from targeted treatments used in HGSOC, e.g., PARP inhibitors. However, the preclinical and clinical knowledge about SEC is scarce, and the exact role of defective DNA repair in this tumor subgroup is largely unknown. We aimed to outline the prevalence of homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), copy-number alterations, and somatic mutations in SEC. OncoScan SNP arrays were applied to 19 tumors in a consecutive SEC series to calculate HRD scores and explore global copy-number profiles and genomic aberrations. Copy-number signatures were established and targeted sequencing of 27 HRD-associated genes was performed. All factors were examined in relation to HRD scores to investigate potential drivers of the HRD phenotype. Ten of the 19 SEC tumors (53%) had an HRD score &gt; 42, considered to reflect an HRD phenotype. Higher HRD score was associated with loss of heterozygosity in key HRD genes, and copy-number signatures associated with non-BRCA1/2 dependent HRD in HGSOC. A high number of SECs display an HRD phenotype. It remains to be elucidated whether this also confers PARP inhibitor sensitivity.",eng,Cancers (Basel),101526829,2072-6694,epublish,33445465,10.3390/cancers13020254,13,2,Cancers (Basel)

One of the reasons for the failure of BC treatment is reportedly the ineffectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs). HER2 receptors have an important role in the self-renewal of BCSCs. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cytokine levels were found to be higher in BCSCs, which demonstrates their potential metastatic capacity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of BCSCs to trastuzumab and to investigate the MMP levels in primary breast cancer cells and HER2+ BCSCs. Tumour tissue samples were obtained during surgical intervention from ten breast cancer patients, and primary culture cells were established from these tissues. Four major molecular subgroups were sorted from the primary culture: HER2+ BCSCs (CD44+CD24-HER2+), HER2- BCSCs (CD44+CD24-HER2-), HER2- primary culture cells (CD44+CD24+HER2-) and triple positive primary culture cells (CD44+CD24+HER2+). These cells were cultured and treated with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and the combination of those three drugs for 96 h. Cellular responses to these drugs were determined by XTT cytotoxicity test. MMPs and cytokine array analysis showed that MMPs and TIMP-1, TIMP-2 proteins were expressed more in HER2+ BCSCs than in primary culture. HER2- BCSCs were more resistant to drugs than HER2+ BCSCs. Our findings suggest that the presence of HER2- BCSCs may be responsible for primary trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ BC cell population. Further studies investigating the function of MMPs are needed for drug targeting of BCSCs.",eng,Clin Exp Med,100973405,1591-8890,aheadofprint,33471244,10.1007/s10238-021-00685-0,NA,NA,Clin Exp Med

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide.

None had been diagnosed with, or evaluated for, pancreatobiliary maljunction, but on retrospective analysis of radiologic images, 12/66 were found to have pancreatobiliary maljunction. The clinical findings were: F/M=5.7; mean age, 48; most (77%) presented with abdominal pain; mean size, 2.9 cm; choledocholithiasis 11%. Gross/histologic examination revealed 3 distinct pathology-based categories: (I) Cystic dilatation of native ducts (81%).

Finally, we revealed that ENST00000389093 and ENST00000568883 possess pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity and may have functional roles in metabolism, cell invasion, and hypoxia response in cancer cells. Our study provided a potential explanation to the controversial prognostic indication of PKM, and could invoke future studies focusing on revealing the biological and oncological roles of these alternative spliced variants of PKM.",eng,Cancers (Basel),101526829,2072-6694,epublish,33478099,10.3390/cancers13020348,13,2,Cancers (Basel)

Label=""PATIENTS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Patients with an unfavorable CUP diagnosis, as defined by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and available cancer tissue for molecular sequencing are generally eligible. Potential CUP patients entering screening undergo a review involving reference histopathology and clinical work-up by a central Eligibility Review team (ERT). Patients with &quot;favorable&quot; CUP, a strongly suspected primary site of origin, lack of tissue, or unmet inclusion criteria are excluded.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":As of April 30, 2020, 628 patients had entered screening and 346 (55.1%) were screen failed. Screen fails were due to technical reasons (N=89), failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria not directly related to CUP diagnosis (N=89) and other reasons (N=33). 124 (35.8%) patients were excluded because unfavorable adeno- or poorly differentiated CUP could not be confirmed by the ERT. These cases were classified into 3 groups ineligible due to (i) histologic subtype, such as squamous and neuroendocrine, or favorable CUP; (ii) evidence of a possible primary tumor or (iii) non-carcinoma histology.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Experience with CUPISCO has highlighted challenges with standardized screening in an international clinical trial and the difficulties in diagnosing unfavorable CUP. Re-confirmation of unfavorable CUP by an ERT in a clinical trial can result in many reasons for screen failures.

Although they have positive effects on the treatment of various disease states; long-term administration is associated with high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. The heart attempts to cope with increased blood pressure and a decrease in glucose utilization by developing pathological cardiac remodeling. However, in this process, cardiac fibrosis formation and deterioration in heart structure and functions occur. Galectin-3, a member of the β-galactoside binding lectins, is consistently associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the pathogenesis of various disease states including insulin resistance and heart failure. Galectin-3 expression is markedly increased in activated macrophages and a subset of activated fibroblasts and vascular cells. Also, failing and remodeling myocardium show increased Gal-3 expression and elevated Gal-3 levels are related to heart failure severity and prognosis. Furthermore, Gal-3-related pathways are recently suggested as therapeutic targets both pharmacologically and genetically to increase insulin sensitivity in vivo. The objective of this review is to provide a summary of our current understanding of the role of glucocorticoid-associated insulin resistance, which is important for some cardiac events, and the potential role of galectin in this pathophysiological process.",eng,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,9717231,1095-6670,aheadofprint,33484019,10.1002/jbt.22717,NA,NA,J Biochem Mol Toxicol

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has been known to be a risk factor for the development of more severe form of saphenous vein graft disease after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We aimed to evaluate the impact of type II-DM on histopathological features of great saphenous vein grafts of patients undergoing CABG PATIENTS AND METHODS: . Forty consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG were enrolled into the study. Patients were grouped into two; Diabetic group (n=20); includes patients with preoperative diagnosis of type II-DM and Non-diabetic group (n=20): those without type II-DM. In all patients, a short segment of the great saphenous vein graft at the level of medial malleolus was taken for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evaluation. Moreover, immunoexpressions of Caveolin-1, Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were studied RESULTS: . There were no differences in the demographics of patients between two groups. The magnitude of intimal fibrosis in diabetic group was slightly higher than in non-diabetics (1.95±0.99 versus 1.3±0.8, p=0.04). In TEM, vacuolization in endothelial cells, substance accumulation along with coarse collagen fibers and cytoplasmic degeneration with vacuolization in muscle cells were detected in diabetic group. While there were no differences in Caveolin-1 and VCAM-1 immunostaining, the intensity of positive eNOS immunostaining was significantly higher in endothelium (2.10±0.64 versus 1.55±0.68, p=0.01) and tunica media 1.75±0.63 versus 1.2±0.52, p= 0.007) in non-diabetic group, respectively) compared with diabetic group CONCLUSION: .

We aimed to determine the miRNA profile in mice applied to two different CR protocols; chronic (CCR) and intermittent (ICR) and follow the MT development. In addition, the roles of miRNAs involved in adiponectin and/or leptin signaling pathways were investigated. Mice were enrolled into ad-libitum (AL), CCR, or ICR which was three-weeks AL feeding followed by one-week of 60% CR in cyclic manner. Blood and tissue collection were performed at weeks 10, 17/18, 49/50 and 81/82. Long-term CCR provided better protection compared to ICR for MT development with a delay in the MT occurrence. Adiponectin expression in mammary fat pad were significantly higher in CCR group compared to AL.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of α-lipoic acid (ALA) treatment on the anti-inflammatory activity of indomethacin (Indo) as well as the possible therapeutic effect of ALA on high dose Indo-induced gastropathy in female mice. Mice were treated with Indo (5 or 30 mg/kg, p.o) alone or in combination with ALA (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg, i.p). in vivo anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by formalin-induced paw edema measured as paw thickness and edema. Gastric damage was evaluated macroscopically and histologically by scoring mucosal hemorrhage, erosion, edema and inflammation. To our results, Indo was ineffective at 5 mg/kg, but co-treatment with Indo and ALA significantly reduced paw edema, implying that ALA augmented the anti-inflammatory effect of subtherapeutic dose of Indo. However, ALA was not able to induce a further increase in the anti-inflammatory effect of Indo at 30 mg/kg. Unlike the treatment with Indo at 5 mg/kg, Indo at 30 mg/kg caused severe gastric damage that prevented by co-treatment with ALA. These results suggest that combination of ALA with NSAIDs can both increase anti-inflammatory effect and prevent NSAIDs-induced gastric damage.

Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GH and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10 min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40 min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs.

Multilevel analysis was performed to identify patient- and tooth/site-related predictors for the 12-month MRC outcomes. Postoperative patient morbidity and histological characteristics of palatal graft samples obtained during harvesting were investigated.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":At the 12-month follow-up, MRC was 91.72±16.59% and 84.72±19.72% in DGG+TUN and SCTG+TUN groups (P=0.001). Multilevel regression analysis identified RD, KTH, and GT as variables associated with MRC. No significant difference between the groups was observed regarding postoperative patient morbidity parameters. Cellularity was found significantly higher in the SCTG samples compared to the DGG samples (P&lt;0.05).

On the other hand, patient- and tooth/site-related prognostic indicators may have a critical role in obtaining the treatment outcomes.                 Label=""PRINCIPAL FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":DGG combined with TUN showed higher mean root coverage (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) compared to SCTG in the treatment of MAGRs. Nevertheless, tooth/site related prognostic factors could impact root coverage outcomes regardless of CTG harvesting technique. Both procedures showed similar outcomes in terms of patient's postoperative morbidity and aesthetic evaluation at the 1-year follow-up.

The majority of these transcripts are uniquely expressed in differentiated tissues or specific glioma types. Pediatric oligodendroglioma (POG) is a rare subtype of diffuse glioma and accounts for &lt;1% of pediatric brain tumors. Because histologically POG resembles adult OG, the same treatment is applied as adults. However, the significance in predicting outcomes in POG patients is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of expression -profiles of microRNA (miRNA) and long noncoding RNA -(LncRNA) in POGs.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We investigated the levels of 13 known miRNAs and 6 LncRNAs in tumor samples from 9 patients with primary POG by using RT-PCR and analyzed their association with outcomes.

This comprehensive global population study elucidated the historical migration pathways of the pathogen to reveal the Eurasian origin of the fungus. When over 3800 isolates were examined, three major population clusters were revealed: North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, with distinct subclusters in the highly diverse Eastern European cluster. Modeling of historical scenarios using approximate Bayesian computation revealed the North American cluster was derived from an ancestral population in Eurasia. The Northeastern European subcluster was shown to be ancestral to all other European clusters and subclusters. The Turkish subcluster diverged first, followed by the Central European subcluster, then the Western European cluster, which has subsequently spread to much of the Southern Hemisphere. All clusters and subclusters contained both mating-types of the fungus, indicating the potential for sexual reproduction, although asexual reproduction remained the primary mode of reproduction.

In this study, MOF-embedded electrospun fiber scaffold for the controlled release of BMP-6 was developed for the first time, to enrich bone regeneration efficacy. The scaffolds were achieved by first, one-pot rapid crystallization of BMP-6 encapsulated ZIF-8 nanocrystals-as a novel carrier for growth factor molecules- and then electrospinning of the blending solution composed of poly (ε-caprolactone) and BMP-6 encapsulated ZIF-8 nanocrystals. BMP-6 molecule encapsulation efficiency for ZIF-8 nanocrystals was calculated as 98%. The in-vitro studies showed that, the bioactivity of BMP-6 was preserved and the release lasted up to 30 days. The release kinetics fitted the Korsmeyer-Peppas model exhibiting a pseudo-Fickian behavior. The in-vitro osteogenesis studies revealed the superior effect of sustained release of BMP-6 towards osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. In-vivo studies also revealed that the sustained slow release of BMP-6 was responsible for the generation of well-mineralized, new bone formation in a rat cranial defect.

Deficiencies in vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) proteins, key regulators of trafficking, cause abnormal intracellular segregation of macromolecules and organelles and are linked to human disease. VPS proteins function as part of complexes such as the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, composed of VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39 and VPS41. The HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 has been reported to promote viability of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease but to date has not been linked to human disease. Here, we describe five unrelated families with nine affected individuals, all carrying homozygous variants in VPS41 that we show impact protein function. All affected individuals presented with a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of cognitive impairment, cerebellar atrophy/hypoplasia, motor dysfunction with ataxia and dystonia, and nystagmus. Zebrafish disease modelling supports the involvement of VPS41 dysfunction in the disorder, indicating lysosomal dysregulation throughout the brain and providing support for cerebellar and microglial abnormalities when vps41 was mutated.

Changes in the amount and chemical structure of phospholipids, proteins, and lipids were investigated in the blood and serum samples of the animals using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. To evaluate biological events associated with the wound repair process in inflammatory phase we used oxidant and antioxidant status to determine the healing status of wounds such as Total antioxidant status (TAS), Total oxidant level (TOS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels. TOS level increased in DM groups and decreased in the AV and HPO group. Oxidative stress index decreased and TNF-α level increased in the HPO group. FTIR spectra showed changes in the phospholipids, proteins, and carbon chain of lipids in the whole blood as well as serum of DM rats. FTIR spectra combined with Principal component analysis (PCA) showed, that treated DM rats by AV and HPO caused return chemical structure of blood and serum to this observed in control group.

The aim of this study was to scrutinize the utility of three immunohistochemical markers including Forkhead box protein 2 (FOXL2), SOX9, and β-catenin and DICER1 mutation status in distinguishing SCTATs from other ovarian SCSTs. Nine cases of SCTAT, 10 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SCLT), 10 adult-type granulosa cell tumor (AGCT), and 8 juvenile-type granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) were included in the study. SCTATs were characterized by diffuse and strong expression of SOX9, focal and weak expression of FOXL2, and the absence of DICER1 mutation. However, AGCTs and JGCTs displayed strong and diffuse expression of FOXL2, focal/no immunoreaction for SOX9. SLCTs generally showed moderate intensity of FOXL2 and SOX9 expression. Nuclear β-catenin expression was observed in none of SLCT, 1/9 of SCTAT, 6/8 JGCT, and 4/10 AGCT cases, respectively. DICER1 hotspot mutation was detected in only 3 cases of SLCT and 2 cases of JGCT. We conclude that in addition to strong and diffuse SOX9 expression, weak/absent expression of FOXL2 is suggestive for the diagnosis of SCTAT. Hence, we suggest that inclusion of these two markers, SOX-9 and FOXL2, to the immunohistochemical panel helps in differentiation of SCTAT from other SCSTs in addition to morphologic findings.

This retrospective case-control study has been conducted on a cohort of patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy between 2015 and 2017 due to complex injury treatment. The outcomes were assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES), the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Score, need for non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumption and the visual analog scale (VAS). Complications and changes in smoking status were also noted. A cohort of 59 patients underwent shoulder arthroscopy, due to complex LHBT pathology and RCTs, and were enrolled in the final follow-up examination; with mean duration of 26.03 months. According to smoking status, 27 of patients were classified as smokers, and the remaining 32 were non-smokers. In the examined cohort, 36 patients underwent the LHBT tenotomy and 23 tenodesis. We observed a relationship between smoking status and distribution of various RCTs (p &lt; 0.0001).

There were no statistically significant differences in pre/postoperative ASES and postoperative UCLA scores between smokers and non-smokers (p &gt; 0.05). The VAS was significantly lower in the non-smokers' group (p = 0.0021). Multi-tendon injuries of the shoulder are a serious challenge for surgeons, and to obtain an excellent functional outcome, we need to limit the negative risk factors, including smoking. Furthermore, there is a significant association between smoking and the occurrence of massive rotator cuff tears, and the pain level measured by the VAS. Simultaneous surgical treatment of RC and LHBT lesions in the smoker population allowed us to obtain the functional outcomes approximated to non-smokers in the long-term follow-up.

Angiogenesis is important for mesothelioma progression, but so far, anti-angiogenic agents have not improved patient survival. Our hypothesis is that better understanding of the regulation of angiogenesis in this tumor would largely improve the success of such a therapy. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that acts as a co-receptor in various cellular processes including angiogenesis. In MM, the expression of SDC-1 is generally low but when present, SDC-1 associates to epithelioid differentiation, inhibition of tumor cell migration and favorable prognosis, meanwhile SDC-1 decrease deteriorates the prognosis. In the present study, we studied the effect of SDC-1 overexpression and silencing on MM cells ability to secrete angiogenic factors and monitored the downstream effect of SDC-1 modulation on endothelial cells proliferation, wound healing, and tube formation. This was done by adding conditioned medium from SDC-1 transfected and SDC-1 silenced mesothelioma cells to endothelial cells. Moreover, we investigated the interplay and molecular functional changes in angiogenesis in a co-culture system and characterized the soluble angiogenesis-related factors secreted to the conditioned media. We demonstrated that SDC-1 over-expression inhibited the proliferation, wound healing, and tube formation of endothelial cells. This effect was mediated by a multitude of angiogenic factors comprising angiopoietin-1 (Fold change ± SD: 0.65 ± 0.07), FGF-4 (1.45 ± 0.04), HGF (1.33 ± 0.07), NRG1-β1 (1.35 ± 0.08), TSP-1 (0.8 ± 0.02), TIMP-1 (0.89 ± 0.01) and TGF-β1 (1.35 ± 0.01). SDC-1 silencing increased IL8 (1.33 ± 0.06), promoted wound closure, but did not influence the tube formation of endothelial cells. Pleural effusions from mesothelioma patients showed that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels correlate to soluble SDC-1 levels and have prognostic value. In conclusion, SDC-1 over-expression affects the angiogenic factor secretion of mesothelioma cells and thereby inhibits endothelial cells proliferation, tube formation, and wound healing.

Acquired EV develops in immunocompromised patients such as HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Patients with a prior history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have tendency to develop generalized verrucosis. We report an extraordinary case of disseminated epidermodysplasia verruciformis seen in a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome who had undergone HSCT. He had plane, brown papules involving his face, forearms, neck, anterior chest, nape, back, and knees.

Capmatinib (CAP), a novel mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition inhibitor, is reported to attenuate pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress. In this study, the effects of CAP on lipogenesis in the adipocytes were examined. Treatment with CAP dose-dependently suppressed lipid accumulation in, and differentiation of, and increased lipolysis in, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, CAP treatment augmented adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and FNDC5 expression in the adipocytes. Transfection with si-AMPK or si-FNDC5 mitigated the CAP-induced suppression of lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis.

Label=""PRESENTATION OF CASE"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 36-year-old woman was admitted with extensive surgical site inflammation after a caesarean section. Despite antibiotic treatment and wound care, the clinical course deteriorated rapidly. Wound debridement following negative pressure closure was performed due to an immediate increase in skin necrosis. A diagnosis of PG was reached based on the absence of a positive wound culture, resistance to wound debridement and the histopathological results. A course of high-dose corticosteroids was started, and a successful clinical course was finally achieved. The patient is now in the 14th month of remission, with no recurrence.

Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19. Although not clinically investigated yet, the applicability of flavonoids against COVID-19 could be a promising strategy due to a broad spectrum of their biological activities.",eng,Biomed Pharmacother,8213295,0753-3322,aheadofprint,33662680,10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111430,138,NA,Biomed Pharmacother

When the tourniquet is released, reperfusion injury occurs with the resumption of blood flow. Molecular hydrogen can easily attach to biomembranes and enter cytosol, mitochondria and other organelles of the cell and convert the formed OH- to H₂O to prevent cell and tissue damage.

Label=""STUDY DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Thirty-six Wistar-albino male rats were randomly divided into six groups. No operations were performed in the Sham group. Ventral penile Mathieu type flap was prepared and Pt was applied to the root of the penis with a plastic band in other groups. Pt was applied 10 and 30 min in the PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. HRSS was injected intraperitoneally (ip) 5 ml/kg just before Pt was released in the HRSS1⁰ and HRSS³⁰ groups. In the HRSSB group, HRSS was injected 1 h before 10 min of Pt application. At the 4th hour of experiments the rats were sacrificed and tissue samples were taken for biochemical and histopathological studies. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were determined in the penile tissue. The results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Pearson's Chi-Squared test.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Tissue MDA, MPO, IL-6 and TNF-α values were significantly lower in all HRSS groups compared to PT1⁰ and PT³⁰ groups. Tissue GSH levels of HRSS groups were higher compared to PT groups. Histopathologically, inflammation was found to be higher in PT groups compared to HRSS groups. Interestingly, in the HRSSB group with HRSS administration prior to Pt, the damage was less in grade, but not statistically different than the other HRSS groups (p &gt; 0.05).

A significant proportion of cases presents as clinically and grossly inapparent lesions, and grossing protocols are not well established. Among epithelial alterations, pseudo-pyloric gland metaplasia is ubiquitous and of no apparent consequence, whereas goblet cell metaplasia and a foveolar change in surface cells require closer attention. Low-grade dysplasia is difficult to objectively define and appears to be clinically inconsequential by itself; however, extra sampling is required to exclude the possibility of accompanying more significant lesions. For high-grade dysplasia (&quot;high-grade BilIN&quot; a.k.a. &quot;carcinoma in-situ&quot;), a complete sampling is necessary to rule out invasion. Designating in-situ or minimally invasive carcinomas limited to muscularis or above as early gallbladder carcinoma (EGBC) helps alleviate the major geographic differences (West/East) in the criteria for &quot;invasiveness&quot; to assign a case to pTis or pT1. Total sampling is crucial in proper diagnosis of such cases. A subset of invasive GBCs (5-10%) arise from the intracholecystic neoplasm (ICN, &quot;adenoma-carcinoma sequence&quot;) category. About 2/3rds of ICNs have invasive carcinoma. However, this propensity differ by subtype. True &quot;pyloric gland adenomas&quot; (&gt; 1 cm) are uncommon and scarcely associated with invasive carcinoma. A distinct subtype of ICN composed of tubular, non-mucinous MUC6+ glands (intracholecystic tubular non-mucinous neoplasm-ICTN) forms a localized pedunculated polyp.

It is a potential candidate for developing intervention strategies to delay the development/progression of AMD. In the current study, the effect of a novel, highly purified BCX oral formulation on the rat retinal damage model was evaluated. Rats were fed with BCX for four weeks at the doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg body weight in the form of highly bioavailable oil suspension, followed by retinal damage by exposing to the bright light-emitting diode (LED) light (750 lux) for 48 hrs.

BCX supplementations (2 and 4 mg/kg) showed improvements in the visual condition as demonstrated by histopathology of the retina and measured parameters such as total retinal thickness and outer nuclear layer thickness. BCX supplementation helped reduce the burden of oxidative stress as seen by decreased serum and retinal tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and restored the antioxidant enzyme activities in BCX groups. Further, BCX supplementation modulated inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, and NF-κB), apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3), growth proteins and factors (GAP43, VEGF), glial and neuronal proteins (GFAP, NCAM), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), along with the mitochondrial stress markers (ATF4, ATF6, Grp78, Grp94) in the rat retinal tissue.

It is positioned between wheat and rye in terms of resistance to soilborne pathogens including Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Fusarium culmorum, F. avenaceum, and Bipolaris sorokiniana (Arseniuk and Góral 2015). In 2019, seven triticale fields were surveyed in Almaty Province, Kazakhstan to examine soil-borne fungal pathogens. A total of 28 symptomatic plants with stunting, rot or discolored root were collected to identify causal agents. The overall disease incidence was approximately 8 to 10% in the fields. Fungi were isolated from 3-5 mm pieces excised from symptomatic tissues. The pieces were exposed to surface disinfection in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, blotted dry, and plated on 1/5 strength potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 0.01% streptomycin. Plates were left in the dark at 23°C for 7 days. A total of 34 fungal colonies were isolated of which nineteen isolates, originally from six fields showed the cultural characteristics of B. sorokiniana. This species was previously reported to cause common root rot on triticale in Kazakhstan (Özer et al. 2020). Ten isolates from four fields produced pale orange and cottony mycelium with red pigmentation on the agar, which is typical of Fusarium-like growth. The remaining isolates (n=5) from two fields produced salmon-colored and scarce aerial mycelium with no soluble pigmentation, similar to Microdochium spp. Fusarium isolates produced thick-walled and curved macroconidia with 3-4 septa (n=50, 25.7 to 37.6 × 4.1 to 7.3 μm in size) and notched basal cell on PDA, but microconidia were absent, which matches the description of F. culmorum (Wm.G. Sm.) Sacc. (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Microdochium isolates produced swollen, brown, and thick-walled chlamydospores and hyaline, one-celled, and thin-walled conidia (n=50, 5.4 to 9.3 × 1.5 to 3.0 μm in size) formed on ampullate and cylindrical conidiogenous cells on oatmeal agar (OA). These morphological features are consistent with previous observations for Microdochium bolleyi (R. Sprague) de Hoog &amp; Herm.-Nijh. (Hong et al. 2008). To confirm morphological preliminary identifications, the portion of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) gene was amplified with EF1/EF2 primers (O'Donnell et al. 1998) for representative Fusarium isolates (n=4) for each field. Additionally, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA was amplified with ITS1/ITS4 primers (White et al. 1990) for representative Microdochium isolates (n=2) for each field. BLASTn queries against NCBI GenBank revealed that the EF1-α sequences of Fusarium isolates (MW311081-MW311084) shared 100% identity with F. culmorum strain CBS 110262 (KT008433). The ITS sequences of M. bolleyi isolates (MW301448-MW301449) matched that of M. bolleyi strain CBS 137.64 (AM502264) with 100% sequence similarity. Pathogenicity test was conducted on pregerminated seeds of triticale cv. Balausa. A plastic pot (17 cm height, 9 cm in diam) was filled with a sterile mixture of vermiculite, peat, and soil (1:1:1, v/v/v). Mycelial plugs (1 cm in diam) were cut from the margin of a growing culture of representative isolates (Kaz_Fus123 and Kaz_Mb01) and placed onto the mixture in the pot. A sterile agar plug was employed as a control treatment. One pregerminated seed was put on the plug and covered with the mixture. The pots were transferred to a growth chamber set at 23 ± 2°C and a photoperiod of 14 hours. The experiment was performed twice using 5 replication pots per isolate. Four weeks after inoculation, discoloration of the crown was observed on all the inoculated roots, whereas no symptoms were observed on the control plants. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reisolating and identifying the pathogen based on the morphology described above. This is the first report of M. bolleyi and F. culmorum causing root rot on triticale in Kazakhstan. Although B. sorokiniana is the most primary pathogen that may limit yield in the production of triticale in Kazakhstan, F. culmorum and M. bolleyi have been found to be less frequent and less aggressive pathogens, respectively. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential distribution and impact of these pathogens on triticale.",eng,Plant Dis,9882809,0191-2917,aheadofprint,33656364,10.1094/PDIS-12-20-2659-PDN,NA,NA,Plant Dis

Although several hypotheses have been suggested, the etiopathogenesis of SANT remains unknown. It is also unclear whether SANT is a reactive or a neoplastic lesion. Since CTNNB1 (β-catenin gene) exon 3 mutations were frequently detected in some rare fibrovascular lesions, we aimed to investigate the presence of oncogenic CTNNB1 mutations in SANT cases. For this purpose, 7 cases of SANT with typical histopathological features were retrieved. First, the presence of CTNNB1 exon 3 alterations was examined with a recently described immunohistochemistry-based method. Then, the findings were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and Sanger sequencing. In all cases, immunochemistry of β-catenin gave a staining pattern that was suggestive of exon 3 alteration; however, no missense mutations were found in any case at the CTNNB1 exon 3 hotspot region. Subsequently, we screened for large interstitial deletions of CTNNB1 exon 3 which revealed short PCR products in three cases. Sequencing confirmed that these cases had large interstitial deletions, resulting in loss of the entire exon 3 of CTNNB1. In the remaining four cases, loss of exon 3 was documented at the cDNA level, although genomic deletion was not identified. These results demonstrate that loss of CTNNB1 exon 3 and stabilization of β-catenin with activation of Wnt signaling pathway might have a significant role in the pathogenesis of SANT.

CD4+ T cells in patients with IPEX syndrome and Foxp3-deficient mice were analyzed by single-cell cytometry and RNA-sequencing, revealing heterogeneous Treg-like cells, some very similar to normal Treg cells, others more distant. Conventional T cells showed no widespread activation or helper T cell bias, but a monomorphic disease signature affected all CD4+ T cells. This signature proved to be cell extrinsic since it was extinguished in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice and heterozygous mothers of patients with IPEX syndrome. Normal Treg cells exerted dominant suppression, quenching the disease signature and revealing in mutant Treg-like cells a small cluster of genes regulated cell-intrinsically by FOXP3, including key homeostatic regulators. We propose a two-step pathogenesis model: cell-intrinsic downregulation of core FOXP3-dependent genes destabilizes Treg cells, de-repressing systemic mediators that imprint the disease signature on all T cells, furthering Treg cell dysfunction. Accordingly, interleukin-2 treatment improved the Treg-like compartment and survival.",eng,Nat Immunol,100941354,1529-2908,aheadofprint,33833438,10.1038/s41590-021-00910-8,NA,NA,Nat Immunol

In the affected male of family 2, we found this variant in a compound heterozygous state together with a novel frameshift variant (c.329_332delTCTG, p.Leu112Valfs*8), which is the second frameshift variant known so far in PYROXD1. We have been able to define a large homozygous region in family 1 sharing a common haplotype with family 2 in the critical region. Our data suggest that c.464A&gt;G is a Turkish founder mutation. To gain deeper insights, we performed a systematic review of all published PYROXD1-related myopathy cases. Our analysis showed that the c.464A &gt; G variant was found in 87% (20/23) of the patients and that it may cause either a childhood- or adult-onset phenotype, irrespective of its presence in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

They are among the important public health problems with increasing prevalence worldwide. Although it is claimed that there are strong relations between them, the mechanism of this relationship has not been fully clarified yet. On the other hand, the effect of this relationship on the offspring has been another research subject. In this study, obese zebrafish were obtained by feeding two different diets, one containing high amount of lipid (HF) and the other containing high amount of carbohydrate (HK), and their anxiety levels were evaluated. To establish a relationship between these two phenomena, in addition to histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis in the brain tissues of fish, the transcription levels of some genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms were determined. In addition, offspring were taken from obese zebrafish and studied to examine the effect of parental obesity on offspring. As a result, it was observed that the HC diet, causing more weight increase than the HF diet, showed an anxiolytic while the HF diet an anxiogenic effect. It was suggested that the probable cause of this situation may be the regulatory effect on the appetite-related genes depending on the upregulation severity of the PPAR gene family based on the diet content. In addition, it was also suggested that it may have contributed to this process in neuron degenerations caused by oxidative stress. Regarding effects on offspring, it can be concluded that HF diet-induced obesity has more negative effects on the next generation than the HC diet.Level of evidenceNo Level of evidence: animal study.",eng,Eat Weight Disord,9707113,1124-4909,aheadofprint,33710522,10.1007/s40519-021-01140-5,NA,NA,Eat Weight Disord

Although the liver is the primary organ responsible for metabolizing many compounds including pesticides, to the authors' knowledge there have been no studies on the direct hepatotoxic effects of 3-PBA. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible hepatotoxic effects of 3-PBA on a Human Hepatoma Cell Line (HepG2) and the underlying apoptotic mechanisms. Firstly, an LC50 of 1041.242 µM was calculated for 3-PBA by using the WST-1 test with concentrations ranging between 1 µM and 10 mM. Following that, the HepG2 cells in the experimental group were exposed to 3 different concentrations of 3-PBA (1/5 LC50, 1/10 LC50 and 1/20 LC50) for 24 hours. The apoptotic mechanism was evaluated by using flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays for Caspase 3 and Bcl-2. In the flow cytometry assay, the total number of apoptotic cells increased in a dose dependent manner (p &lt; 0.05). In the immunofluorescence assay, the Caspase 3 protein showed strong immunoreactivity in the experimental groups, while the reaction to the Bcl-2 protein was minimal. These results demonstrated that 3-PBA has a significant hepatotoxic effect on HepG2 cells and induces apoptosis via the regulation of Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. Furthermore, our results could further the understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of 3-PBA hepatotoxicity.

Although these represent significant risk factors or comorbidities for ischemic stroke, PHACTR1 role in brain small vessel ischemic disease and ischemic stroke most important survival mechanism, such as the recruitment of brain collateral arteries like posterior communicating arteries (PcomAs), remains unknown. Therefore, we applied exome and genome sequencing in a multi-ethnic cohort of 180 early-onset independent familial and apparently sporadic brain small vessel ischemic disease and CADASIL-like Caucasian patients from US, Portugal, Finland, Serbia and Turkey and in 2 C57BL/6J stroke mouse models (bilateral common carotid artery stenosis [BCCAS] and middle cerebral artery occlusion [MCAO]), characterized by different degrees of PcomAs patency. We report 3 very rare coding variants in the small vessel ischemic disease-CADASIL-like cohort (p.Glu198Gln, p.Arg204Gly, p.Val251Leu) and a stop-gain mutation (p.Gln273*) in one MCAO mouse. These coding variants do not cluster in PHACTR1 known pathogenic domains and are not likely to play a critical role in small vessel ischemic disease or brain collateral circulation. We also exclude the possibility that copy number variants (CNVs) or a variant enrichment in Phactr1 may be associated with PcomA recruitment in BCCAS mice or linked to diverse vascular traits (cerebral blood flow pre-surgery, PcomA size, leptomeningeal microcollateral length and junction density during brain hypoperfusion) in C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Genetic variability in PHACTR1 is not likely to be a common susceptibility factor influencing small vessel ischemic disease in patients and PcomA recruitment in C57BL/6J mice.

IL-22 is produced by RORγt+ innate and adaptive lymphocytes, including ILC3, γδ T, iNKT, Th17, and Th22 cells and some granulocytes. IL-22 receptor is expressed primarily by non-hematopoietic cells. IL-22 is critical for barrier immunity at the mucosal surfaces in the steady-state and during infection. Although IL-22 knockout mice were previously shown to develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), how temporal IL-22 manipulation in adult mice would affect EAE course has not been studied previously. In this study, we overexpressed IL-22 via hydrodynamic gene delivery or blocked it via neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice to explore the therapeutic impact of IL-22 modulation on the EAE course. IL-22 overexpression significantly decreased EAE scores, demyelination, and reduced infiltration of IFN-γ+IL-17A+ Th17 cells into the central nervous system (CNS). The neutralization of IL-22 did not alter the EAE pathology significantly. We show that IL-22 mediated protection is independent of Reg3γ, an epithelial cell-derived antimicrobial peptide induced by IL-22. Thus, overexpression of Reg3γ significantly exacerbated EAE scores, demyelination, and infiltration of IFN-γ+IL-17A+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ Th17 cells to CNS. We also show that Reg3γ may inhibit IL-2-mediated STAT5 signaling and impair expansion of Treg cells in vivo and in vitro.

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Twenty five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups (n = 5 per group): (i) control, (ii) 8-week dutasteride (0.5 mg/kg/day, in drinking water), (iii) 12-week dutasteride, (iv) 8-week dutasteride+HUCB-MNCs (1 × 106) and (v) 12-week dutasteride+HUCB-MNCs. HUCB-MNCs were administered intracavernosally after eight weeks of dutasteride treatment. Experiments were performed at 4 weeks following the injection of HUCB-MNCs. Erectile responses and isometric tension of corpus cavernosum (CC) were measured. The protein expressions of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and smooth muscle/collagen contents in penile tissue were evaluated by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively.                 Label=""MAIN OUTCOME"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In vivo erectile function, in vitro relaxant and contractile responses of CC, protein expression and localization of PDE5, eNOS, nNOS, HIF-1α, and smooth muscle content in penile tissue.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Erectile responses in the dutasteride-treated groups were significantly decreased compared with controls (P &lt; .001), persisting after 4-wk of washout. HUCB-MNCs restored diminished intracavernosal pressure responses, acetylcholine-, sodium nitroprusside-, sildenafil-induced relaxations, and increased phenylephrine and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions. Decreased EFS-induced relaxations in dutasteride-treated groups were not restored by HUCB-MNCs. Increased PDE5 and reduced nNOS expressions in dutasteride groups were restored by HUCB-MNCs in the 12-week dutasteride group. eNOS and HIF-1α protein expression and serum total and free testosterone  levels were similar among groups. HUCB-MNCs reversed the decreased smooth muscle/collagen ratio in dutasteride-treated tissues. There was a significant increase in PDE5 and HIF-1α staining in 8-week dutasteride animals.                 Label=""CLINICAL TRANSLATION"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":This study demonstrates the corrective potential of HUCB-MNCs on some persistent structural and functional deterioration caused by 5ARI treatment in rats, which may encourage further evaluation of HUCB-MNCs in men with PPED.                 Label=""STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Therapeutic application of intracavernosal HUCB-MNCs is a novel approach for the rat model of post-5ARI ED.

Management of this disease, most often through the use of resistant cultivars and crop rotation, requires an accurate understanding of an area's pathogen population structure and phenotypic characteristics. This study improved the understanding of the state's pathogen population by completing multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of two housekeeping genes (BT and TEF) and two loci (ITS and IGS), aggressiveness and race-determining bioassays on 72 isolates collected between 2011 and 2015 from major watermelon production areas in North, Central, and South Florida. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) failed to group race 3 isolates into a single large clade; moreover, clade membership was not apparently correlated with aggressiveness (which varied both within and between clades), and only slightly with sampling location. The failure of multilocus sequence analysis using four highly conserved housekeeping genes and loci to clearly group and delineate known Fon races provides justification for future whole genome sequencing efforts whose more robust genomic comparisons will provide higher resolution of intra-species genetic distinctions. Consequently, these results suggest that identification of Fon isolates by race determination alone may fail to detect economically important phenotypic characteristics such as aggressiveness leading to inaccurate risk assessment.",eng,PLoS One,101285081,1932-6203,epublish,33764995,10.1371/journal.pone.0248364,16,3,PLoS One

33779261,2021,3,0191-2917,Plant disease,First Report of Crown Rot Caused by Fusarium redolens on Wheat in Kazakhstan.,10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0015-PDN,"Fusarium crown rot, caused by several species within the genus, is a major constraint that results in significant losses in wheat production worldwide. In June 2019, diseased wheat plants with typical symptoms of crown rot, including discoloration on the first two or three internodes of the stem just above the soil line and stunted, dry rotted, and discolored roots were collected in several bread wheat fields during the maturity stage in Almaty, East Kazakhstan, and Karaganda Regions of Kazakhstan. For each field, approximately twenty tillers were randomly sampled. Symptomatic tissues were surface sterilized in 1% NaClO for 2 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water three times, air-dried in a laminar flow hood, and then transferred to Petri dishes containing one-fifth strength potato dextrose agar (PDA). After incubating in the dark at 23°C for 5 days, 79 single-spore isolates showing cultural and microscopic characteristics of Fusarium were obtained on PDA and Spezieller-Nährstoffarmer agar (SNA). Colonies were initially white but later produced a beige to pink diffusible pigment in PDA. Microconidia that formed on aerial monophialides were hyaline, 0 to 1 septum, oval- to kidney-shaped, and measured 4.3 to 10.3 × 1.9 to 3.4 µm (average 7.8 × 2.6 µm), whilst macroconidia were straight to slightly curved, 3 to 5 septate, and measured 18.7 to 38.8 × 2.9 to 6.6 µm (average 29.9 × 4.7 µm), with foot-shaped basal cells on SNA. Chlamydospores were present on PDA. Sequence analysis based on portions of translation elongation factor 1α (TEF1) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS rDNA) loci with primers EF1/EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998) and ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) identified 29 of the 79 isolates as Fusarium redolens Wollenw. The sequences of the five representative isolates with 99.85% of similarity to those of F. redolens strains available in GenBank e.g., ITS (MT435063) and TEF1 (GU250584). The TEF1 (accession nos. MW403914-MW403918) and ITS rDNA (accession nos. MW397138-MW397142) sequences of the isolates were deposited in GenBank. The morphological features are consistent with the described features of F. redolens (Leslie and Summerell 2006). To confirm pathogenicity of the five isolates, five pre-germinated seeds of wheat cultivar Seri 82 were placed in a 9-cm-diameter pot filled with a sterile potting mix containing equal volumes of peat, vermiculite, and soil. An approximately 1-cm-diameter 7-day-old mycelial plug of each isolate was individually placed in contact with the seeds. Seeds were covered with the same potting mix, and then the pots were maintained for four weeks in a growth chamber at 23°C with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was conducted twice with three replicate 15-cm pots with 5 plants per pot. Controls were inoculated with sterile agar plugs using the same procedure. After four weeks, all the inoculated plants showed stunted growth with brown discoloration in most parts of the crown and roots, whereas no symptoms were observed in the control plants. The mean severity of the disease for each isolate was between 2.1 and 2.7 according to the scale of 1 to 5 described by Gebremariam et al. (2015). The pathogen was reisolated from crowns of diseased plants, but not from asymptomatic control tissues, and identified morphologically based on the methods described above, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Although several morphological features are shared by F. oxysporum and F. redolens, Baayen et al. (2001) showed that these species could be easily distinguished using molecular data. The pathogen was previously reported as F. redolens associated with crown rot of wheat in Turkey (Gebremariam et al. 2015) and Saskatchewan, Canada (Taheri et al. 2011). The presence of F. redolens causing crown rot is confirmed in the six wheat fields surveyed in Kazakhstan, for the first time. This pathogen may pose a risk for wheat production, and further studies needed to determine the impact on the crop in Kazakhstan.",eng,Plant Dis,9882809,0191-2917,aheadofprint,33779261,10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0015-PDN,NA,NA,Plant Dis

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Histopathology agreement based solely on hematoxylin and eosin stainings was low in Round 1, and gradually increased by adding a panel of immunostainings in Round 2 and the Delphi consensus method in Round 3. Interobserver agreement was good in Round 4 (kappa = .65), when the results of genetic tests were disclosed, namely, MTOR, AKT3, and SLC35A2 brain somatic mutations in five cases and germline mutations in DEPDC5 and NPRL3 in two cases.                 Label=""SIGNIFICANCE"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The diagnoses of FCD 1 and 3 subtypes remained most challenging and were often difficult to differentiate from a normal homotypic or heterotypic cortical architecture. Immunohistochemistry was helpful, however, to confirm the diagnosis of FCD or no lesion. We observed a genotype-phenotype association for brain somatic mutations in SLC35A2 in two cases with mild malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy. Our results suggest that the current FCD classification should recognize a panel of immunohistochemical stainings for a better histopathological workup and definition of FCD subtypes. We also propose adding the level of genetic findings to obtain a comprehensive, reliable, and integrative genotype-phenotype diagnosis in the near future.",eng,Epilepsia,2983306R,0013-9580,aheadofprint,33949696,10.1111/epi.16899,NA,NA,Epilepsia

Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or to induce cellular T cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health. Indeed, academic and private companies have ongoing joint efforts to develop novel vaccine prototypes for this virus. Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as 'tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens' (TACA). Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective IgG responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the latest advancements in development of vaccines against glycan epitopes to gain selective immune responses, and to provide an overview on the role of different immunogenic constructs in improving glycovaccine efficacy.",eng,FEBS J,101229646,1742-464X,aheadofprint,33934527,10.1111/febs.15909,NA,NA,FEBS J

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in the formation and development of many cancer types by regulating expression of their targets. While many studies have investigated the relationship between miRNAs and cervical cancer, no robust miRNA biomarkers have been defined yet for diagnosis of cervical lesions. In this study, we performed a statistical meta-analysis to identify miRNAs and a class compassion analysis to evaluate mRNAs with the power to discriminate between normal, intraepithelial lesions and invasive cancer samples. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were compared with the targets of meta-miRNAs. After bioinfomatics analysis and qRT-PCR validations with cytology samples and FFPE tissues, we defined miR-25 and its target KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4) as candidate biomarkers for in vitro studies. Our results showed that miR-25 expression was significantly higher in precancerous lesions and invasive carcinoma while presenting consistent expression patterns in both cytological and FFPE tissue samples. In line with this, its direct target KLF4 expression decreased in precancerous lesions in cytological samples and also in the invasive cancer group in FFPE tissues. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that mir-25 inhibition decreased proliferation and motility of HeLa cells and promoted an increase in the protein level of KLF4.

We reviewed the factors affecting DSM, including the extent of disease (paranasal sinus, palatal, orbital or intracranial involvement) and blood parameters (BP) that are serum glucose level (SGL), white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein and hemoglobulin levels. Also, the effect of SGL in diabetes mellitus and BP in hematological malignancies on DSM was additionally evaluated.

Peripheral and brain cholesterol levels are largely independent due to the impermeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), highlighting the importance of studying the role of brain cholesterol homeostasis in AD. We first tested whether metabolite markers of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism were altered in AD and associated with AD pathology using linear mixed-effects models in two brain autopsy samples from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Religious Orders Study (ROS). We next tested whether genetic regulators of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism were altered in AD using the ANOVA test in publicly available brain tissue transcriptomic datasets. Finally, using regional brain transcriptomic data, we performed genome-scale metabolic network modeling to assess alterations in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism reactions in AD. We show that AD is associated with pervasive abnormalities in cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism. Using transcriptomic data from Parkinson's disease (PD) brain tissue samples, we found that gene expression alterations identified in AD were not observed in PD, suggesting that these changes may be specific to AD. Our results suggest that reduced de novo cholesterol biosynthesis may occur in response to impaired enzymatic cholesterol catabolism and efflux to maintain brain cholesterol levels in AD. This is accompanied by the accumulation of nonenzymatically generated cytotoxic oxysterols.

In particular, TGF-β/SMAD induces growth arrest, and SMAD4 induces the expression of target genes such as p21WAF1 and p15INK4b through its interaction with several cofactors. Thus, inactivating mutations or the homozygous deletion of SMAD4 could be related to tumorigenesis or malignancy progression. However, in some cancer types, SMAD4 is neither mutated nor deleted. In the current study, we demonstrate that TGF-β signaling with a preserved SMAD4 function can contribute to cancer through associations with negative pathway regulators. We found that nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) is a novel interaction SMAD4 partner that inhibits TGF-β/SMAD4-induced p15INK4b mRNA expression by binding to SMAD4. Furthermore, we confirmed that NRF1 directly binds to the core region of the SMAD4 promoter, thereby decreasing SMAD4 mRNA expression. On the whole, our data suggest that NRF1 is a negative regulator of SMAD4 and can interfere with TGF-β/SMAD-induced tumor suppression.

Its clinical utility as an oral anticancer agent, however, is limited by poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal toxicity. Fosciclopirox, the phosphoryloxymethyl ester of CPX (Ciclopirox Prodrug, CPX-POM), selectively delivers the active metabolite, CPX, to the entire urinary tract following parenteral administration. We characterized the activity of CPX-POM and its major metabolites in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of high-grade urothelial cancer. CPX inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroid formation, and increased cell cycle arrest at S and G0/G1 phases. Mechanistically, CPX suppressed activation of Notch signaling. Molecular modeling and cellular thermal shift assays demonstrated CPX binding to γ-secretase complex proteins Presenilin 1 and Nicastrin, which are essential for Notch activation. To establish in vivo preclinical proof of principle, we tested fosciclopirox in the validated N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) mouse bladder cancer model. Once-daily intraperitoneal administration of CPX-POM for four weeks at doses of 235 mg/kg and 470 mg/kg significantly decreased bladder weight, a surrogate for tumor volume, and resulted in a migration to lower stage tumors in CPX-POM treated animals. This was coupled with a reduction in the proliferation index. Additionally, there was a reduction in Presenilin 1 and Hes-1 expression in the bladder tissues of CPX-POM treated animals. Following the completion of the first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT03348514), the pharmacologic activity of fosciclopirox is currently being characterized in a Phase 1 expansion cohort study of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients scheduled for cystectomy (NCT04608045) as well as a Phase 2 trial of newly diagnosed and recurrent urothelial cancer patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (NCT04525131).",eng,Cell Death Dis,101524092,NA,epublish,34059639,10.1038/s41419-021-03836-z,12,6,Cell Death Dis

This work further expands their activity profile by identifying seven benzylamine-containing dithiocarbamate derivatives with piperazine and piperidine substitutions at the main moiety, and five piperazine-containing dithiocarbamates with various substitutions at the piperazine moiety as new inhibitors of α-glucosidase. Compounds bearing the benzylamine moiety exhibited more potent inhibition of the enzyme than the piperazine derivatives. Majority of the compounds noncompetitively inhibited α-glucosidase that led to the identification of a new allosteric site on the enzyme with the help of molecular dynamics and docking studies. These studies suggest that the compounds regulate inhibition of the enzyme by binding to an allosteric site that is located in the vicinity of the active site. This is the first report on the allosteric inhibition of α-glucosidase by dithiocarbamate derivatives that provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme at molecular level.

Brown lesions (3-5 mm in length) were present on the roots of sampled plants, with 20% incidence. To determine the causal agent, diseased roots were surface disinfected in sodium hypochlorite solution (1%) for 3 min, rinsed triple with sterile distilled water, air-dried in a laminar flow hood, and plated onto one-fifth strength potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 50 ppm chloramphenicol. After three days, the hyphal fragments that developed from the sections were transferred to fresh PDA and incubated at 23°C with 12-h photoperiod for 7 days to obtain pure cultures. Brown pigmented fungal colonies with a constriction at the base of hyphal branches, septa near the branching point, and right-angled branching resembling Rhizoctonia solani were observed. The identification anastomosis group (AG) of a representative isolate for each field was conducted by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA with the universal primers ITS4 and ITS5 (White et al. 1990). The resulting sequences of 693 bp length were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MW898143:MW898146). These sequences were 100% identical to the isolate 8Rs of R. solani AG2-1 (accession no. AF354063). To confirm the pathogenicity of the four isolates, the colonized wheat kernels method described by Demirci (1998) was used to inoculate a sterile potting mix containing peat, vermiculite, and soil (1:1:1 by v/v/v) into which wheat (cv. Seri) was planted. Control pots were inoculated with sterile wheat kernels using the same procedure. Wheat plants were left to grow for four weeks under controlled environmental conditions with a 23°C temperature regime. During the period that the plants remained in the glasshouse, the typical light regime was 16 h. Brown lesions were observed on the roots of plants in the inoculated pots whereas no symptoms were observed on plants grown in the control pots. R. solani was consistently reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby confirming Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani AG2-1 on roots of wheat in Kazakhstan. R. solani AG2-1 isolates have been previously reported to be a weak pathogen to wheat (Roberts and Sivasithamparam 1986; Sturrock et al. 2015; Jaaffar et al. 2016; Özer et al. 2019).

The peptide hormones adropin and spexin modulate many physiological functions such as energy balance and glucose, lipid and protein metabolism.

In view of the limited information, we aimed to investigate the effect of adropin and spexin on matrix metalloproteinase and inflammatory response genes a rat model of adenine-induced chronic kidney failure. Chronic kidney failure was induced in rats by administering adenine hemisulfate. Renal function was determined in an autoanalyzer. Histopathological modifications were assessed by H&amp;E staining. mRNA expression levels of ALOX 15, COX 1, COX 2, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-18 IL-21, IL-33, KIM-1, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-13, NGAL, TGFβ1, TIMP-1, and TNFα in kidney tissue were measured by qPCR. Our results showed an increase of 24-h urine volume, serum creatinine, BUN, and urine protein levels in group with adenine-induced CKF. Adropin and spexin treatments decreased urine protein and 24-h urine volume. Renal damage, TIMP-1, IL-33, and MMP-2 increased after CKF induction, while COX 1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 levels were significantly reduced.

All probands share a global developmental delay accompanied by pyramidal tract involvement, microcephaly, short stature, strabismus, dysmorphic facial features, and seizures. The human phenotype is less severe compared with the Bcas3 knockout mouse model and cannot be explained by angiogenic defects alone. Consistent with being loss-of-function alleles, we observed absence of BCAS3 in probands' primary fibroblasts. By comparing the transcriptomic and proteomic data based on probands' fibroblasts with those of the knockout mouse model, we identified similar dysregulated pathways resulting from over-representation analysis, while the dysregulation of some proposed key interactors could not be confirmed.

We used genome editing to generate isogenic iPSC lines and model HSS in relevant cell types. By combining genomics with functional in vivo and in vitro assays, we show that CHD6 binds a cohort of autophagy and stress response genes across cell types. The HSS mutation affects CHD6 protein folding and impairs its ability to recruit co-remodelers in response to DNA damage or autophagy stimulation.

In this study, we investigated the effects of kefir supplementation on the intestine-liver-adipose tissue axis in metabolic disorder induced by high-fructose diet in rats to describe mechanistic action and potential therapeutic value of kefir. Fructose was given to the rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 15 weeks. Kefir was administrated by gastric gavage once a day during the final six weeks. Kefir supplementation improved metabolic parameters, including plasma triglyceride and insulin levels; hepatic weight, triglyceride content and fatty degeneration; omental fat mass in fructose-fed rats. Kefir supplementation decreased the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in feces, as well as necrotic degeneration, expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but increased expression of tight-junction proteins occludin and claudin-1, in the ileum of the fructose-fed rats. Kefir treatment also reduced the mRNA levels of key lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) together with a decline in expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), NF-κB, and glycosylated glycoprotein (CD68) in the liver.

Consequently, kefir supplementation suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and inflammatory status, but promotes insulin signaling, in association with a change of the fecal microbiota and attenuation of the intestinal permeability factors in high-fructose-fed rats.

In low-risk group, complete surgical resection is typically sufficient, whereas in high-risk thymoma, adjuvant therapy is usually required. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between both. This study evaluated the CT radiomics features of thymomas to discriminate between low- and high-risk thymoma groups.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":In total, 83 patients with thymoma were included in this study between 2004 and 2019. We used the Radcloud platform (Huiying Medical Technology Co., Ltd.) to manage the imaging and clinical data and perform the radiomics statistical analysis. The training and validation datasets were separated by a random method with a ratio of 2:8 and 502 random seeds. The histopathological diagnosis was noted from the pathology report.

We report 25 families containing 34 individuals with neurological disease associated with biallelic HPDL variants. Phenotypes ranged from juvenile-onset pure hereditary spastic paraplegia to infantile-onset spasticity and global developmental delays, sometimes complicated by episodes of neurological and respiratory decompensation. Variants included bona fide pathogenic truncating changes, although most were missense substitutions. Functionality of variants could not be determined directly as the enzymatic specificity of HPDL is unknown; however, when HPDL missense substitutions were introduced into 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD, an HPDL orthologue), they impaired the ability of HPPD to convert 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate. Moreover, three additional sets of experiments provided evidence for a role of HPDL in the nervous system and further supported its link to neurological disease: (i) HPDL was expressed in the nervous system and expression increased during neural differentiation; (ii) knockdown of zebrafish hpdl led to abnormal motor behaviour, replicating aspects of the human disease; and (iii) HPDL localized to mitochondria, consistent with mitochondrial disease that is often associated with neurological manifestations.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis in a GIMAP5-deficient mouse model reveals replacement of LSECs with capillarized endothelial cells, a reduction of macrovascular hepatic endothelial cells, and places GIMAP5 upstream of GATA4, a transcription factor required for LSEC specification.

The records of 31 women who underwent myomectomy for FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas in a university hospital setting were analysed. Group I (n = 16) was composed of women that were symptomatic for AUB and group II (n = 15) consisted of asymptomatic cases. The myomectomy material(s) of each case were processed with CD34 staining and evaluated by Image J® software (Image J 1.52a, Wayne Rasband National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). There was no statistically significant difference between the rates of vascular areas in the specimens of the two groups (p&gt;.05). Although areas with large vessels were higher in group I compared to group II, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p&gt;.05). AUB caused by FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas seems to be related to factors other than vascular density.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign gynaecologic neoplasms with a prevalence of approximately 40% in women of reproductive age. They are most often asymptomatic but when symptomatic, abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is one of the most commonly observed symptoms. Although there are some hypothetical explanations, the exact pathogenesis underlying leiomyoma-associated AUB has not yet been elucidated. Almost a century ago, the vascular abnormalities of fibroids were hypothesised as one of the etiopathological factors correlated with clinical symptoms, such as AUB, and current data suggest that the vascular map of leiomyomas consists of an avascular core surrounded by a vascularised capsule. To our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature comparing the histopathological evaluation of the vascularity scores of FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas in symptomatic (with AUB) and asymptomatic (without AUB) women.What the results of this study add? The study revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the vascularity scores of FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas excised from the symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Large vessel densities also did not statistically significantly differ between the two groups.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This study revealed that AUB caused by FIGO Type 4-7 leiomyomas was related to factors other than vascular density.",eng,J Obstet Gynaecol,8309140,0144-3615,aheadofprint,33938365,10.1080/01443615.2021.1882969,NA,NA,J Obstet Gynaecol

In our study, we have collected clinical histories of 13 patients with IL-21R deficiency from eight families across seven centers worldwide, including five novel patients identified by exome or NGS panel sequencing. Eight unique mutations in IL21R were identified in these patients, including two novel mutations. Median age at disease onset was 2.5 years (0.5-7 years).

We detected Wt1 in cardiomyocytes from embryonic day (E10.5), the first time point investigated, until adult age. Cardiac Wt1 mRNA levels decreased during embryonic development. In the adult, Wt1 was reactivated in cardiomyocytes 48 h and 3 weeks following myocardial infarction. Wt1 mRNA levels were increased in differentiating mESCs. Overexpression of Wt1(-KTS) and Wt1(+KTS) isoforms in ES cells reduced the fraction of phenotypically cardiomyocyte differentiated clones, which was preceded by a temporary increase in c-kit expression in Wt1(-KTS) transfected ES cell clones and induction of some cardiomyocyte markers. Taken together, Wt1 shows a dynamic expression pattern during cardiomyocyte differentiation and overexpression in ES cells reduces their phenotypical cardiomyocyte differentiation.",eng,Int J Mol Sci,101092791,1422-0067,epublish,33919406,10.3390/ijms22094346,22,9,Int J Mol Sci

All collated ASGs updated since January 2010 containing recommendations on antimicrobial therapy for at least three conditions affecting different organ systems in cats and dogs underwent detailed review including AGREE II analysis. Out of forty countries investigated, fifteen ASGs from eleven countries met the inclusion criteria. Several critical principles of antimicrobial use were identified, providing a framework that should assist development of stewardship guidance. The AGREE II analysis highlighted several methodological limitations of the currently available ASGs. This study sheds light on the lack of national ASGs for dogs and cats in multiple European countries and should encourage national bodies to prioritize guideline development in small animals.

We have examined the Pro12Ala-(rs1801282) and C161T-(rs3856806) polymorphisms of the PPARgamma gene in Turkish patients with BC in this case-control study. A total of 95 women diagnosed with BC as cases and 119 controls were genotyped for PPARgamma polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques.

The growth of a new network of blood vessels is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis, which is promoted by several proangiogenic factors. Leptin, an essential adipokine that is secreted from fat tissue, is one of these pro-angiogenic factors. It has been shown that the inhibition of leptin-induced angiogenesis resulted in decreased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR2, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α, NF-κB, IL-1 and Notch and reduced the tumor growth in breast cancer. Leptin induces angiogenesis in breast cancer either by upregulating VEGFR2 in endothelial cells or by increasing VEGF/VEGFR2 expression through the Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) pathway. NILCO is a novel mechanism that interacts with proinflammatory and proangiogenic signals, which are critical for cell proliferation and angiogenesis in cancer. Several studies have shown that components of NILCO may affect human cancer incidence and progression. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interactions between Notch, IL-1 and leptin in human colorectal cancer have not been yet studied at the molecular level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression levels of genes related to the NILCO pathway in human colorectal cancer specimens. The current results demonstrated that leptin, leptin receptor (ObR) b, Notch-1, Notch-4, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1R, IL-6, JAK-2, STAT-1, STAT-3, VEGFA, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, TNF-α and NF-κB mRNA expression levels in the cancer tissue were increased compared with the normal tissue. No significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of Jagged-1, HIF-1α and TNF receptor 1 were observed. Western blotting revealed that the protein expression levels of IκB were increased in the cancer tissue compared with normal tissue, whereas HIF-1α and phosphorylated STAT-1 levels were decreased. IL-6 and VEGFA plasma concentrations were statistically raised and the leptin plasma concentration was also raised, although significantly, patients with cancer compared with control individuals.

Whereas human desmin protein is encoded by a single gene, two desmin paralogs (desma and desmb) exist in zebrafish. Desma and desmb show differential spatiotemporal expression during zebrafish embryonic and larval development, being similarly expressed in skeletal muscle until hatching, after which expression of desmb shifts to gut smooth muscle. We generated knockout (KO) mutant lines carrying loss-of-function mutations for each gene by using CRISPR/Cas9. Mutants are viable and fertile, and lack obvious skeletal muscle, heart or intestinal defects. In contrast to morphants, knockout of each gene did not cause any overt muscular phenotype, but did alter calcium flux in myofibres.

After scanning the other quadrants, however, the tumor was not observed at the right ureteral orifice. It was then protruded back into the bladder. The tumor was seen several times to protrude into the bladder and return to the ureter, possibly due to ureteral peristalsis.

It was shown that the tumor-suppressor microRNA-124 (miR-124) is associated with the Wnt pathway. Thus, we aimed to measure miR-124 expression levels to evaluate whether it is a prognostic marker or a potential treatment strategy. Thirty tumor and 30 surrounding healthy kidney tissues from the same subjects diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), were included in the study. The expression levels of miR-124 were measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and determined by the 2-ΔΔCT method. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22 program was used for statistical analyses and a p value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The expression levels of miR-124 was found to be about 3-fold lower in tumors than in healthy tissues (p 0.001) and decreased expression levels correlated with tumor stage, tumor diameter, body mass index (BMI) and neutrophil values (p 0.05). Our results showed that miR-124 expression levels are associated with RCC. MicroRNA-124 may be assessed as a biomarker in prognosis and the restoration of miR-124 expression might be effective in the treatment of RCC.",eng,Balkan J Med Genet,9806959,1311-0160,epublish,33816075,10.2478/bjmg-2020-0029,23,2,Balkan J Med Genet

In some countries, older adults, particularly those residing in nursing homes, have been prioritised to receive COVID-19 vaccines due to high risk of death. In very rare instances,the COVID-19 vaccines can induce anaphylaxis, and the management of anaphylaxis in older people should be considered carefully. An ARIA-EAACI-EuGMS (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and European Geriatric Medicine Society)Working Group has proposed some recommendations for older adults receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccines is extremely rare (from 1 per 100,000 to 5 per million injections). Symptoms are similar in younger and older adults but they tend to be more severe in the older patients. Adrenaline is the mainstay treatment and should be readily available. A flowchart is proposed to manage anaphylaxis in the older patients.",eng,Allergy,7804028,0105-4538,aheadofprint,33811358,10.1111/all.14838,NA,NA,Allergy
